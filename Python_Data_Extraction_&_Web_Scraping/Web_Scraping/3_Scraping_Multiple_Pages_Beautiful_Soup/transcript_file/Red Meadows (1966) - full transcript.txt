Can you hear it, nephew, how the time is passing? Like old wine. Advertise your product or brand here contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today For Heaven's sake! Come one, let's go! Leave it. Mark it in the registry as another dead. We'll hand over our sheep tomorrow. Come in the evening, for the papers. They are of no use to me. I already said what I had to. It's an order from up top. From the district headquarters. Top or bottom... whatever it is from... I won't hand over anything. Sava will do it, then. Whatever. My name is Lie, good man, son of Nucu Ciobanu [the Sheperd]. I know. The one with the short hair, he's... "Hallelujah", I know him. It's Sava, Son of Milciu Ciobanu [the Shepherd]. They call me Burtă [Belly]... Burtă Mocanu. Mocan [Mountain Shepherd] or Cioban [Shepherd], same difference. We are shepherds for generations. The whole village has shepherd's blood. If we slaughter our flocks, what are we left with? With our names and our bare bottoms, that's what. That's right, comrade president, that's right. What do you think, Sava? I believe what I see, just that. And what do you see? I see the same things you see. Will you guide the flock? You have to understand, we don't have food for our sheep. Without pastures, we won't have neither milk, nor lambs in the spring. Right, a ram can't think of love on an empty stomach. I remember, about five years ago... you may know, we went to find hay on the Dniester River. There are a lot of pastures near the Dniester. Might be, but an order is an order. Come to the office tonight. This comrade is from the newspaper. Andrei Gruia. We don't have pretty faces for the newspaper. You sure? Maybe Burtă... for such a face, you need a big newspaper. Uncle Trofim! Uncle Trofim! I filled it up already, what more do you want? Just one more... You make me sin. I am here to do my job. You'll photograph us? Maybe. And how much will that cost us? Nothing. I'm paid by the newspaper. Nothing? Completely for free. Drink! Come on, townie! Here you have a shepherd of turkeys and chickens, townie. Our sheep are gone. Burtă! The chairman is calling for you. I'm busy. What are you doing? I'm grieving. A shepherd without his sheep is like the Danube without water. There's a place at the Dniester, the Red Meadows they call it. Enough fatty grass, higher than your knee. We'll bring triple profit in the winter and our flocks whole. I know those places well. I've been there. It's a lot of complicated work... We need permission from the authorities, stamped papers. May these authorities think clearly like us, and they won't say no. That's right, comrade chairman. That's right. If they aren't on our side, whose side would they be? Do as you know best. We'll be accountable together. That's right, comrade chairman. That's how it is. Do you really care what you'll write in the newspaper? You see, I have my responsibilities: a few lines about you, about the shepherds of Călimana. You go over that hill and you'll be right at the bus stop. But the town is on our way, so... We won't go through town. Is there a slaughter house closer to here? They'll manage a little bit longer without us. We aren't butchers, son. We are shepherds. Perhaps you'll take me with you? Who is this? Ioana, uncle Ilutsa's daughter. Old man's daughter? Clearly not my daughter. Hey, comrade. What's your name? Oh, you are a mute? Just a moment... Did you get it? Hey! This autumn, should we become family, uncle Ilutsa? Look... this belt is full of money. She'll be a queen. We'll build a new house. I'll send her to study, Sava. She's smart. That's what her mother wanted, God bless her. She'll come back... tired of studying and of love. You'll find another one. I'll kidnap her. You won't, Sava. Townie! Do you speak the donkey language? I don't, yet. You see, the donkey does... but you don't. Look! You see? You are remarkable, Sârghe. That's what I think, too. Hey! Hey! Why won't you tell me your name? Oh, I got it. Your name is... Ioana. You like walking around with the flock? I'm helping my father, and making some cash. How about school? Just one month. We won't need more. Good night! ♪ [Some version of Chubby Checker - Dancin' Party] ♪ Why are you showing off your jewels? Have a little shame. Father! Father, come here! Father! Give me the hat. Are they going mad? We'll become mad ourselves from this heat. They won't move from here. They are starving. We have to get them to the pastures. Uncle Ilutsa, he's put his glasses on, to see the microbes. Shut up! You can't see microbes with no glasses. Why did you do that?! Stop your flock! Stop the flock! What if they ate some forage from there? It's a crime, that forage is not ours. So that's how you are, townie. On the one hand, you drink your wine with water... but still you are strong. Some water? You see, townie? We've made a shepherd out of you. Under Ioana's wise supervision. Shepherd's blood, right? Sure, 'cause we made her in the sheephold. You have no shame, father! You say the most bizarre things. At school you learn every detail, but here you are all so innocent. Ioana, Ioana, matador from Călimana! What's that, a matador? Those who fight bulls. Crazies. Not really, uncle Ilutsa, those are brave men. Listen to me... Corrida, corrida is starting... everything is silent... and silence means death. He's staying still. In his yellow costume, the matador seems made of stone. Fixing him with his raging eyes, the black bull is in front of Alvarez. Toro! Toro! Toro! Like a black lightning, the bull runs towards the toreador. The stands are crazy! The bull is trying another move. But his legs refuse to listen. Alvarez!, shout the crazed stands. Bravissimo! Bravissimo! And? What's next? In the meantime, a child cried in the stable. Amango, the black bull, was killed. His friend. They wandered together the hills and valleys. How about that, comrades? Thieving in the middle of the day? Why are talking to us like that? Nobody touched your forage. Nobody, you say? That's right, nobody! You are in luck. From afar, it seemed like you did. So why are you making trouble? Be more careful. I am sorry, comrades. I'd pay with my head, you know how it is. Turculete is my name. Chief brigadier here in the kolkhoz [collective farm]. Brigadier, how about some forage? We measure 50 meters and I'll give you a receipt or cash. - Whatever you prefer. - I can't. Who then? The chairman, the deputy. We'll go to the chairman. He's not here, he's gone. How about the deputy? He's locked up, poor lad, stole a little. Well, how about that! Who's managing this farm then? Until the chairman is back, I am here chief. Be a chief then! Without the chairman, I can't give you anything. My head is on the line. That's it. A head is for... thinking. Listen here, nomads, how about you leave our land? Now. Calm down, son, this is not your property. Ok, uncle, ok. This one was born in autumn. How do you know? Idiots born in the summer are more cheerful. Townie! Open up a piece of paper. Write: From Lie Cruntul, the shepherd, from the Călimana village, "Patria" [the Motherland] kolkhoz. To say that his sheep grazed 50 meters of forage. Today, 28 of July, 1964, in the afternoon. What do you want to do, Lie? To feed the sheep once in ten days. That's a criminal offense. Screw it, we'll be in trouble. We are breaking the law. I don't need a law that kills the sheep, but makes Turculete a chief. Write: For all this, Lie Cruntu is accountable. Lie, can I sign too? No, you don't have that right. You are a stranger to this flock. Father, maybe we too? No, laws are no joke. Uncle Ilutsa... Don't teach me. Townie... take your things and get lost. I am saying this nicely. He may stay if he wants, just don't give lessons to us. Found yourself the man to write petitions to... better beat him good until he's dead. I can't. Pity. We'll measure from here. Lie, this is not for me. Laws are sacred. I'll take care of your flock. Stop it! You are looking for trouble! Get back! Get back or we'll shoot! Don't you hear? Shoot! Comrade brigadier, to kill for some forage? Bursuc [badger], get back! Burtă! You've shot in vain, Turculete. A German took this arm before you. No worries, militsya [soviet police] will deal with you. Militsya. We'll talk to the militsya too, don't you worry. Sava, you are still innocent. You'll take care of the flock until I get back. Go ahead now, I'll catch up. Let's go. Uncle Lie, I'll go with you. No. Go back, Bursuc. Back! Back! ♪ [The Green Leaves of Summer by Dimitri Tiomkin, Sinphony Orchestra] ♪ [The Pioneer] - Good day! - Hi! We'll embark the sheep on the barge. - And we'll be there in one night. - Interesting. Can we count on you or not? Very interesting. That's our only option. Dear, what day is it today? A Sunday. What does that mean? People rest, and me... ?. Tickets please! Ioana! Turn around. Noe's Ark! We are only missing the flood. Fine thing this is! Hey, come on! Move! Townie, you don't "hey" the sheep, you say "hyr!". Thanks. Hyr, hyr! Sârghe, sing us something. Maybe it'll get warmer. ♪ Many roads I have walked. ♪ ♪ Many girls I have kissed. ♪ Leave me alone, bug! ♪ Many girls I have kissed. ♪ ♪ And I've forgotten all of them. ♪ Cat's nose you kissed, Sârghe. Townie, townie, you'll freeze to death with us. I won't, I'm used to it. Here! Thanks! What will you wear? I have another. Fine. - Did Sârghe teach you to whip? - Not yet. You'll teach him, huh? Move! Move! You got it? Look at that, you left me speechless! But can you do this? This autumn, Sava will marry her. He's crazy about her. How would you know? I do. Bursuc, Bursuc! Hello, townie! Uncle Lie! Hello, uncle Lie! The boys have been waiting for you. How's you shoulder, still hurts? Don't worry, just a scratch. How about the militsya? Turculele said I wanted to kill him. The policeman first believed me, then him, then we started again. I saw how it goes and snuck out through the window. Hope they won't give you trouble. I left them word, that I'll be back when the season ends. If they'll need me. Let's go uncle Lie. The shepherds will be happy to see you. No, not right now. I'll make trouble for you too. They'll think you are aiding me. All of you. Until the waters clear... I'll be in the neighbourhood, ok? Service in the middle of the night? That's uncle Ilutsa's convent. Many years ago... here's where he got married. Local monk wed them. Christina died giving birth to Ioana. It was after the war. Hunger and all kinds of ordeals. Was she pretty, Christina? Ioana is just like her. Townie! From now on, note the cheese production in the registry. You are a writer after all. This way, the people won't think you are wasting our food. Leave him alone! Eat! Eat, eat! Write to Călimana, to send a car, to take our produce. - Understood? - Yes. Ok. Look there. What is this loony doing? Looking for the cuckoo's plant [wild thyme]. Yank it with your teeth and throw it in the fire. That's what maidens do around here. They say all wishes will come true afterwards. You like it? That's my invention. I swear! Perpetuum mobile. What? Perpetuum mobile. Yeah, right. Uncle Burtă, will you teach me? Go to Ioana, she has less sheep. - Uncle Ilutsa! - What? She's coming. Come one, come on, just like that. What are you looking at? Look at my hands. Think this is easy? No, on the contrary. Leave it... you are scaring the sheep and getting scared yourself. Easy townie, easy. Want another one? No. You're doing fine. So, how are you? Mister, you should listen to me. I'll make you a shepherd. Hear me? Lie is not doing very good. He should've listened to others. Some sheep may have died... but that would've been it. No troubles for him or for others. We won't be untouched by this. You just wait. That's bad. Listen, Sârghe! Why do you call Sava "Hallelujah"? That's a long story. When he was little, he was an altar boy, helping the priest collect money. Just like this: Hallelujah, Hallelujah... with my hand in your pocket. God bless, God bless, more, not less. Amen and a glass of wine! Take care of Sârghe, looks like he wet himself. Why Sava? Why? You need to become a man. Not a woman wearing pants. A man should have a full pouch and a bull's strength. Look. Put me down. Go away! You try it, townie. Could you do it? Come on! Could you? What are you doing? Look at him! Don't drop dead! Put me down... put me down. Crazy, just crazy. ♪ [Hora Primăverii by Fluieraș Orchestra] ♪ Another one! It tastes like Sun. Almost forgot, there's a letter for you. When you go back in autumn... you'll all become ministers. Your rams are fat and healthy as if from a resort. Tell us what's with the chairman... in simple words. They called him at district headquarters. They talked and talked. They'll probably kick him out now. He's got a lot of trouble because of us. Told you. Anything else? I told him a good one: Comrade chairman, better lose with the bright ones, than win with the stupid. Where's Lie? I want to drink a glass with him. With this rain, Lie is probably in the village. You should go too. You'll get stuck here 'cause of the mud. All right then! If you keep this up, we'll welcome you like generals in the autumn: flowers all the way. Easy... that many flowers - only at funerals. Long live Burtă, King of the Rams! Oh, poor me... Bye, bye! See you soon, Zamfir dear! Haven't seen rain since spring. - Aren't you cold? - No. I haven't seen rain since spring. You upset? I am a maiden. Ready to be wed. Don't play with me. What are you looking for uncle Ilutsa? Devil's horns. What are you trying to do Sârghe? Should've given them to Ioana. I'm not shameless. I don't need a woman to repair my pants. But that's what a woman is for... to help the man in everything. Aren't you a little dumb, Sârghe? Maybe I am, but I am not giving her my pants. You cheapskate, give me some candles, of those you keep for the townie. Againt to the convent, huh? All right, uncle Ilutsa... you think there is a god above us? Maybe not above you, Sârghe, and there is no need. You are young, stubborn, and you have a whole life ahead. But I'll kick the bucket any day now. And if there's a god, if I meet him in Heaven... What do I do? How do I explain myself? Give me the candles. Over here. What's with these sheep, uncle Lie? Sava's sheep. The ones he stole. What is he doing with them? Sells them. Fattens them and takes them to the market. Let's go. Well, well, Sava. Where's the hat? This way is better. Look, since we're here, I haven't grown at all. Sârghe, listen, a smart man grows slowly. What? Did you miss me? Sava, how about you return the sheep? Which ones? Those from the forest. You stalking bitch!

Go look for them. - Leave those papers! - How about this? Look uncle Ilutsa, look Sârghe. He's writing, informing on us. He encouraged Lie. Now wants me gone. But I'm a tougher nut to crack. He's been let go from his job, it's written here: "Dismissed for not showing up at work." "Not showing up." You are good for nothing! Nothing! You've stolen six sheep, Sava. - You promised to return them. - Lies, lies. I didn't. You've stolen six sheep, Sava. Witnesses? No. Don't write any more lies then. Now listen. I saved those sheep. Didn't die so they are mine. I saved them, not the state. When the state pays me for rotting in the field, it may hang me for stealing. I know what's mine, I do. What do you want? Leave it, Lie will clear everything up. - Shut up! - Don't you dare! I am not joking! Uncle Ilutsa? Stand down. These are sweet, frozen by rime. The summer is gone, Ioana. ♪ [Only You by Frank Pourcel playing on the radio] ♪ That's enough, dear. Mull some wine for me... with red peppers, please. - Wait for Andrei, he'll be back soon with medicine. - Ok. How are you, Ilutsa? Oh, Burtă, you see this little thing? It sings in ten voices, but you, this big, only in one. I'll learn. Like hell you will. What's new in Călimana? Wine-making season... Brought you some. Anything else? Wedding season... Let's go home, uncle Ilutsa. Listen townie, pack your bags and leave... immediately. No. Make way. Feeling brave? Sava, Sava! Stop, Sava! Sava, don't make me do something stupid. - Leave! - I was joking, wanted to scare him. Let's go, smartass. Uncle Lie... Uncle Lie is back! Hello, Lie! Hello! Where've you been? Sava, you'll milk all the sheep today... alone. But I was joking, I just wanted to scare him. All of them, by yourself. You'll do it on your knees. Got it? Call him back, to hell with it. I don't forgive myself, let alone others. Unlike a woman, a man deals with it himself. That's how we do it around here. Sing, Burtă, like there's no tomorrow, dance, Zamfir... We'll celebrate life, dying for it, and crushing the scoundrels. You atoned, like a man. Now drink from my glass. I will drink, Lie... but I won't forget. We'll leave for Călimana at dawn. Give me a smoke. Nicht verstehen. My father smoked like a Turk and he lived to be 102. But he didn't drink like you. That's why he died so soon. How much do you plan on living, uncle Ilutsa? With smokes this bad probably less than 100. Ioana! Come here! What? Look, these are for you. No need. Leave me, leave me! Don't be afraid, Ioana! Don't be afraid! Look how they suit you, look! Look! Ioana, Ioana! - What's this? - Just the rain. I this your portrait? Just like you. Where's Lie Cruntul? May God strike me if I saw him. - Search the place. - All right! No need, Comrade Major. - Are you Lie Cruntul? - Yes. Sign here. Arrest warrant, right? Not only. You owe me 2.03 rubles. What for? Next time you sneak out, be careful not to break the window. At least at militsya's office. Coming? - No, no. - You have to. Maybe after I take the sheep to Călimana, I'll drop by your office. We need to take care of this. This problem needs solving. You solved it already. Comrade Major, don't be so upset... For you. Listen. As soon as you are in Călimana, report to the office. This is all I can do for you. Ok, a little more to the right... little more, like this... back, to the left... head down... hand like this... Just a second. A little corny, but very nice. You done? Father said we leave for Călimana tomorrow. Will you come? It's time for me to go back, Ioana. Ioana! Ioana! What happened? You got tired of us, huh? Winter is coming. Cranes left, storks left, now we leave too. Seven winters I'd give for a summer, as the gypsies say. Make yourself a sleigh and come to us in the winter. Until I make it, summer will be back, Sârghe. Sled on your ass then. Time to put out the fire, lads. Let's go uncle Ilutsa, we're behind. Townie, who knows if I'll ever be back here? They say the length of the day comes from the rotation of the Earth... That's right, uncle Ilutsa.
