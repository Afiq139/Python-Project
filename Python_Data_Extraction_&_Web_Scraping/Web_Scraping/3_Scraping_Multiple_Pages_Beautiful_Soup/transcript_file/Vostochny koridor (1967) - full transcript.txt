Now they are coming even in the morning. So we meet again. Now we're all here together. We would like to know what happened then? Open up! What has happened? A thing or two... Who is this? This is my sister, Lena. She asked to stay the night here, after she quarreled with her beau. Do you want something to eat? No! Let's sleep. Make room for me, women! I'm so cold. So good! Why are you shivering? No, it's nothing! You're strange today I'll go and light the stove and cook something It will be warm in the morning. As you wish. Ivan Lobach is a rat. Ziazulia, you suspect everyone! Even yourself! Who will believe this? How will you prove it? He was shot. Shot? He's from the woods. He ran away. You are a brave girl, you know about discipline. He'll be back in the city. Yours? - When did he come? - Just now. Let's go out. I haven't heard anything. Handsome boy. Hairy. This means he's lucky. Who is he: from the woods or from the police? Well, neither. He's a scoundrel. You're a fool, Zhenya! Go to him. - Come on! - Let's go to the porch. Oh, leave me out of this. Is there anything to drink? Why are you quiet? Have you gone mad? Get up! - Zhenya ... - You've been sentenced. Turn around. Our Committee needs to discuss one matter. People in the woods are besieged. They are starving. They need bread. The Birulia group from the grain elevator suggests seizing the grain and transporting it to the woods. To do that we need to contact the 'Motherland' brigade. There is a suggestion: to send Dubovik and Lobach. You need to leave today. You'll arrange the meeting on your own. The operation will be supervised by Dubovik. He didn't show up to see me off to the woods. What's happened to Dubovik? Member of the underground Committee Dubovik voluntarily joined the great Germany [paper is in Belarusian] He will be speaking at the depot on the 25th asking his associates from the city and the woods to give up their weapons. I'll kill him. [with German accent] This is one of the leaders of the underground movement Oles' Dubovik. [Read with German accent] 'Avoid beating Russians. The Russian values his honour. If he is beaten he never forgets it. Thrashing is regarded as uncultivated in Russia. The Tsarist system was and still is so terribly hated because flagellation and execution by hanging were daily occurrences. The Bolshevists realizing this clearly, have strictly forbidden beatings and death by strangulation. In a propaganda lasting for years hangings and beatings were described as the highest measures of barbarity. Today Soviet propaganda even makes use of the hanging of bandits in order to put the Germans on the same level as the Tsarist regime'. From the 10 Commandments for German soldiers in active service. Give it to me! [with German accent] We haven't ill treated him and we haven't tortured him. You see, he is alive and in perfect physical and spiritual health. We have talked to him using the language of facts, mere facts. After we presented all our arguments and we have to say that we haven't concealed anything from him, he had to abandon his comrades. He admitted defeat and calls on his associates from the city and in the woods to lay down arms. Please, don't be so quiet! Say something! Please, don't be so quiet! Ivan, dear! Where did you arrange to meet him? In the Holy Spirit Cathedral. Greetings from a dead man. Easy, old man, I am not a child. Let's discuss things. I was at the depot. I wanted to kill him. Why didn't you do it? They made him wear an overcoat so we couldn't see... Bastards! They beat him up and injured his bladder! His trousers were all wet. He can't talk anymore. But others can. - Who? - Give me your hand, old man. You'll go with me. I won't give you my hand. But I will follow you - to check. Wait here! [in Belarusian] Editorial Office Are you all on your own? Is the Editor at home? Yes, he is. That's his door. - Is he alone? - No, a guest from Berlin came to visit. Listen here, old woman! Not a word! - Who's there? - I have a message for Mr. Sopun. Are you Mr. Sopun? Mr. Editor! I'm from Fiodor Meleshka's troops. Nice to meet you! [speaks with Belarusian accent] He's an old friend of mine. I used to visit him often. Your face looks familiar to me. Probably I have seen you there. I've brought you an article for your newspaper. The partisans have killed a couple of our boys from Samaakhova [Belarusian troops created by Germans] Oh, that's a pity. We shall write about it. Mr. Meleshko invites you to visit him. Unfortunately, I can't. I will write him a letter. Please, leave that article on the table. Where's Dubovik's letter? In the newspaper. It's printed in the newspaper. No, not that. - The one he wrote himself. - The original? It's in the safe. Please, give me my trousers. The keys are there. - Is it Dubovik's handwriting? - Yes. You're lying! This is not his hand! Who wrote this? Who's this? This pale moth is the Editor himself. We need to take him to the woods. Perfect! I'll do it myself. Run! Farewell, my joy, my life, I know, you go away without me. So I have to stay alone. I will not see you for a long time. Dark is the night So you don't believe that I'm going away? No. I am going away. Do you remember that day in May when we went to swim in the river and when we were sitting on the sand on the fine, yellow sand You are beautiful, especially when you're taking a shower and trickles of water are running down your skin. And yet I will sculpt you. You told me that five years ago. But I don't see any masterpiece. Do you want me to do it now? You'll never do it. You get physical pleasure from lazy contemplation. Don't mix laziness and contemplation! A lazy person is sleeping, while a contemplative person is creating. Oh, you've created some mess all right... If not for me, you'd be in prison a long time ago. Your brawls with the Germans... And what would you like? You want me to daub their stupid uniforms like you do? Well... It's time to go. There's someone to see you. I know very well myself Why you, girl, are alone Ziaziulia was captured. He is in Professor Sobol's clinic. They guard him. Why have you come? Are our addresses still safe? You know Dubovik's handwriting [talk with one another in German] General, Sir, I beg for your forgiveness, This is my husband, he is ill. Go to sleep. This is a really unpleasant situation. I beg for your forgiveness once again. My dear! I feel so bad, I'm so lonely... And I have these nightmares... A man riding a white horse with a red fur hat on his head. What could this mean? Something bad will happen. Give me Mom's dream-book. White horse means troubles. Red hat means... What does it say? Red hat means DEATH This is your horse and your red hat. No, no. Something bad will happen. Who is that man on a horse? Ivan. Your Shukhman is with the army and you... What about me? With that one... That policeman... Don't you dare to reproach me! You know that I do it for the child! Why do you need that? Ivan... is a completely different story. Go away. 'In Minsk, in his own office, partisans killed the important German agent Fabian Akinchits and Baranovichi's Commandant Friedrich Fench. Partisans are systematically eliminating the authorities in regions responsible for sending Soviet citizens into German slave labour'. From communique. Look better! [in German] Do you know her? No. Do you work at the grain elevator? Probably she does. What about this one? That's our mechanic Biriulia. Has he threatened you? Yes. Give me your gun. I don't have a gun! What are you doing? What do you want? Wait! Sonny! Take pity on your sister! Give it to them! So, bandit! Maybe you'll remember now? It's in there... In the beehive... But what happened to Dubovik? How was he captured? I only know that with Dubovik you disappeared as well, Kit. I didn't reach Prudishche village. I was captured. For 3 days they had been banging my head against the steel safe. But I didn't split and then I lost consciousness. But even then I didn't give them any names. And then one morning they came. You seem to have regained your consciousness, Sir. Here you go, Sir, there is some paper and a pencil I'm leaving you all to yourself, Sir, together with your doubts. This is your last chance. Keep it in mind, Sir! ID card - Hello, Kit! - Ales'! When I had sclerosis for the first time, I thought 'What a misfortune! I can't bend down, I'm dizzy!' But when more serious diseases started to manifest themselves I started to think back to that nice little illness almost with tenderness. It was only sclerosis, nothing too serious! I was dizzy. Big thing! My head can go on spinning as long as it pleases! It's even pleasant. If only my liver stopped hurting... Ah, even that, let it continue.... If I had a hope to live! A person with one hand thinks he's lucky in comparison to a one-legged person. The one-legged guy thinks of himself as of a handsome man, Hercules compared to a person without legs, the one, who puts a board on four squeaky wheels under his butt. A human being is capable of putting up with everything... Except one thing, as all the torturers of the world know very well. - We're from the grain elevator. - I know. We were in contact with Ziaziulia. - Now it will be me. - Aha. They need bread in the woods. There's a lot of bread. But how can we take it? Biriulia and the lads tried ... We will try again. Hey, come over here! - Where did you get those tins from? - Dear sirs, I haven't stolen them. Come closer, don't be afraid! - Is he with you? - He gave me the tins. The German. Franz Sergeevich. - Have you bought them? - No, he just gave them to me. He told me he would drive me in his car. Well, I will go. - Where are you going? - I'll ask permission from my Mum. Oh, there's no need to ask! Go on, take a ride! Thieving scum! I will scream! [speaks with Byelorussian accent] There are Germans all around here, the whole car of soldiers. Calm down. There are no soldiers in that car anymore. You are in safe keeping. What do you want from me? Was it you who betrayed mechanic Biriulia? I swear, I haven't betrayed him. Do you agree to help the Soviet authorities? I could get you makhorka and soap. We need access to the grain elevator, Supplies Director. We have finished loading; everything was quiet. Give that old man here! You promised to release me at the port! You lied to me! Calm down, pop! Good luck! Time to sail away. Take me back to the city immediately! I have done everything! 80,000 kg of bread! You told me that I need to accompany you to the port and that's it! You lied to me! You have no right to do this! They'll start the pogrom on Wednesday. The newcomers will be destroyed, the Hamburg Jews. - Warn the people in the ghetto. - Is that all? Wait, Goldberg! Our man will come with you. Help him to get that scientist out from there, Grommer. Maedchen! Kommen Sie her! [Girl! Come here, please!] Ask her if she is really Grommer's daughter and where I can find him. Du bist Grommers Tochter? [Are you Grommer's daughter?] I have so much explosive amassed in here, that I could blow up the whole world! - Are you so strong, old man? Yes, I am strong, very strong! But how can I quieten that Hryts'ko? - Who is that? - A policeman. I am hiding from him here. He comes, lights up the matches and sticks them into my head. Well, what about this thing? Wouldn't it be good to deal with Hryts'ko? No... No, take it away, please. I wouldn't want my explosives to kill anyone. That is why I didn't give them to the German army and I won't give them to you either. People have been warned. Listen, Goldberg, you told us that he was a scientist while he.... seems to be just ... I do not want to be in it with anyone... So what, you want him to fight for you? Do you want me to fight for you? I do not want to be responsible for the actions. Do you know that you have been taken here to be destroyed? Young man, have you asked yourself why these craftsmen should be destroyed? You do not know Germans so well, it is not economically efficient. We will be kept in the ghetto till the very end of the war. You are an obtuse old man! For today a pogrom is planned and all of you will be drowned. This is for sure. In an hour there will be soldiers here. Girl, run from him! He is insane! You will perish! Vater, wir mussen nicht mehr warten! [Dad, we can wait no more!] [continues in German] We have go to the Commander of the ghetto immediately and say to him that Professor Sammer is here under the name of Professor Grommer. - No. What do they say? They don't want to go. You will take the boat to the sand spit and we will wait there till it gets dark. Well, let's have a bite. Stop! Stop, you fool! [in German] Help, help, partisans! [distant voices; speaking in German] [? a prayer in Hebrew] Oh God! You see the pain Dear God, [???] ?our pain ???? ?? your daughter Roh ???? ???? And still, there is no such fear that can justify and set free a human being from the responsibility in the face of time. When a human being is dying there, outside, surrounded by the compassion of his own people, he can even feel the tears of rapture well up in his eyes and he will die almost happy. It was easy for me, when I was trusted. No, we could not trust! I... I have lost all the connections... I was left all alone. I have lived for a week in the ruins. Hunger made me come out. No, Ziaziulia, it was not like that. I gave my consent. I thought, well, a piece of paper is not worth much. I decided to use it and to go to the woods, but not to work for them. So that others would not suspect me, they promised to arrange my escape so that other people could see it. I noticed you when you were still in the street. No. You didn't look like you were living in the ruins. I understood right away that you were not there by chance. Why didn't you let people outside know that you signed a consent? There they do not believe it. Lysyi was in my hands but he's outside. You still don't trust me. Lobach Ivan. One of the cell's walls is the eastern side of the corridor During the day, there is no guard there. And this is exactly the point. Ziaziulia thinks we can risk it. - We need explosives. - There will be explosives. How do we get them over to them? - I will try. - Do they search you? - Yes. - So how will you do it? - Little by little, in my belt. Pour, pour more! Freda, is that you? I have recognized you! One more gulp! You destroyed my father and me. Die like a dog! 'In the two years of guerilla war partisans eliminated 30 generals, 6,336 officers, and 1,520 airmen; derailed 3,000 trains, destroyed 476 airplanes, 378 cannons, 895 depots and warehouses'. From communique. You know him, General, he was arrested for starting a fight, that guy with the beard, a sculptor. I decided to pay him special attention. I think he can be useful to us. Why, well, Baron. I agree with your suggestion. But I demand that you see things even more broadly. We do not know them well enough, those beer makers, artists, rentists... mothers with many children... They have never had a gun in their hands, But this is a very special enemy, Baum, even more frightening. [in German] They are here, Mr. Commander. - Did they bring Iegor? - Yes, Sir! - Are they allowed to come in? - Yes. [in Russian] - What is this? - Your portrait. - What is this? - Your stomach. - And this? - These are eyes. Ok, these are eyes. But where is the face? Why would you need a face? So how is it? A stomach instead of a face? Am I so fat? Oh no! Art has to be truthful and understandable. Well, see, Mr. Baum, were these times different, I would have made you with a face. But now it isn't necessary, as there is no face. - What do you mean? - Just this. There isn't. I can't send this to my wife and children. They won't recognize me. Don't worry. They'll recognize you alright. This is you, indeed. Well, there is some resemblance, after all. But, please, understand, everyone wants to see himself rendered in a beautiful, pleasant manner. - Isn't it beautiful, Mr. Iegor? - Quite amusing. Truthful and understandable. There are no differences between us now. It is difficult to tell who is the prison commander and who is the prisoner. And yet, I can send you to the gas chamber while you can't. You can be sent there anyway. Yes. By your guys. However, by our guys as well... As well... What will you take there? How will I look? Well, certainly naked. What's wrong with you? Where's your father? You can rejoice. He died. We can be saved. I have a plan. Get 50 German marks buy or steal some dirty overalls or something similar and fill its pockets with rags soaked in gasoline, oil so I can smear it on myself. Answer me quickly, are there many Jewish workers in the labour colony? How do you exit from here? Do they count or check you? I'm not so bad yet! I can move my legs! If they start beating me up they'll damage my face, and then it's too late. Ah yes! And bring the note to the mechanic from the eastern casemate. I'll call the guard and you will tell him this. Freda! A mug, a soap and a black band. Quickly! Is your name Freda? - Yes. - How do you know Russian? My mother is Russian. - Are you from the Jewish labour column? - Yes. What are you doing here? I clean the corridors. I teach the Commander Russian. You could do something for us. You'll have the documents and the apartment. The Commander locks everything up and leaves. But sometimes he doesn't lock up, and then I remain a master there. - What about the keys to the cell? - They are always with him. Try to take an impression of the keys. Has Ziaziulia set the date already? Not yet. We transfer the trotyl. We managed to smuggle a couple of guns into the cell. - Have you established a connection with Ivan? - Yes. Yes, with the help of the girl from the Jewish labour column. How is he? At 5 he was taken to interrogation. The girl says that he was without his coat and hat. Tell the guys that the railway from Gomel to Brest was blown up in one night. In Minsk Generalkommissar Kube was killed. It all went well. All 11 mines exploded. They won't be able to rebuild that factory. More than 50 tanks were repaired there. Lyuda, the General's been arrested. You need to leave, go into the woods. I have a request. I would like to see my husband. - Iegor, sweetie! - I've been waiting. I've arranged everything. They will only fine you. They say, you are working. I have brought you something to eat. Gromov, Kniazev, all the painters send you their greetings. Lyuda, I have become an ugly person, an awful one. You look like the Apostle Peter. Apostle Peter... Frau Lyudmila, can I have a word? Yes, with you. Please, this way. Take off your clothes. Mr. Baum... Yes, Mr. Iegor? Please, let me go visit my colleagues. To get drunk... Kupalinka, Kupalinka The night is dark And where is your daughter? My daughter is in the garden Look, he's sleeping already. Listen here, sonny, Take the rifle and leave! After they come to their senses, they will go after you. Why not? We'll see you off, as it should be. And you'll deal with him in the ruins. I can't, brothers. Lyuda is there. She is picking the flowers there Iegor, dear! Why did poor Lyuda have to get involved? Well, is she Turkish? She's Russian! Hey, brothers! Do I look like the Apostle Peter? No... I look like this one... Mr. Baum? General, unfortunately, with that guy, we have wasted our time. He is simply a Russian drunkard... She didn't tell him anything about what she was doing. I am sorry, Baum, but it seems to me that on the front line it would be easier for you... Your sentence is very hard... I knew about my sentence while I was still free... While a person is alive, there is always a way to help. You dog! What do you want from me? More of my blood to drink? One of the cells gets ready to flee. No one has managed to do that yet... There are many sick people there... If they succeeded, this would have supported them alright. Have you finally resolved to go with us? Leave me alone! Give me a normal war! Without the hostages! So that no one kicks you in the bladder, no one sews up live rats in your guts... Kitov! Come out with your things! I'm tired... Come here! Why aren't you working? Take a bucket and carry peat to the boiler room. Zhenya! Zhenya! What happened to you? Were you ill? Yes. I was ill. Why are we standing here? Let's go in! No! I can't think clearly! Someone needs to go to the Calvary without meeting the Germans. Who is that person? Me... I didn't have typhus... I ran away from prison. Just now. How long ago was it? I don't remember. Quickly! Take off your clothes. They're looking for some woman down there. I won't be able to get out... Put on some lipstick! My dear! Calm down! You're shaking all over! Take little Misha and go with him. We'll meet at Calvary. Lena... Go! Schneller! Schneller! Go further! Go further! [in Polish] Quick! Quick! [in German] Here. There. Sick? Sick? Here! What should I say? Say that you are healthy. - They destroy those who are sick. - It can't be true. I was told that the healthy ones are sent to Germany, while the sick ones remain here. I have diabetes. Are you healthy? Then here. You? Here. - Are you sick? - Say that you're healthy. - Healthy or sick? - I have diabetes. Sick ones go there. Hurry up, hurry up! You? Hurry up! I am sick. Well, lads, if we succeed, let's meet in 3 days, as we agreed. Freda! Have you brought the key? I'm asking you, have you brought the key? Ivan, you won't be able to walk... Your legs... I will, sweetie. Just open up. There'll be no other chance. I know you have the key in your hands. Do it! Smear my face. Give me the gun! 'Our army has freed the village of Stozhyshche, the first one on Belarusian soil'. From communique. The End
