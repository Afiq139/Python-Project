Seems like just yesterday he was the little shit rat. How come you haven't told Jesse that you're going away for college? 'Cause it's not a sure thing. - You're such a liar. - It's not. Besides, my mom would be all alone, or she'd be alone with my dad, which is infinitely worse. And Jesse and I are still figuring things out. - Must be nice. - What? Just that when the universe throws you a bone, you don't swat it away like some mangy cock in your face. Okay, there's zero guarantee I'd even get the scholarship. You have to pass an interview. I mean, it's… - It's like a whole big thing. - Well, if it were me, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. What kinda shakes do you want? Yeah, they want vanilla. Get out you, fucking perv.

They always say shit like, uh… "In my day cars used to cost a nickel." - You know? - He's tripping. Like us, in the future, we'll say… "Hot dogs were made of pig lips and…" - Ew. - "…and assholes. Not fucking space beans or whatever." - Ew. - That's really lovely. Thank you. You mean are we gonna rag on the next generation the same way people do about us? - Definitely. - No. Like, this is our day. We're in it. We need to do something epic. We should go hike Migizi Falls. Hiking? That is your idea of epic? Yeah. Fuck it. Fuck it, I'm in. - No. - Fuck, yeah. - Guys, no. - One. Guys, aren't the falls still off limits 'cause of Danny Hagel? What's a Danny Hagel? He was this older kid. He went to our middle school and he jumped the falls on a school trip. Fat little fucker was found tits up a mile down the river. Vince. - I heard it was a suicide. - See? Everybody remembers how he died. But how'd he live? Legend. Is this your way of saying you wanna jump the falls? You know, the thought never crossed my mind. You know what? You guys have fun.

Oh, Alex, you're home. I didn't hear you come in. How was the bonfire? It got rained out. I'm really tired, so I'm gonna go right to sleep, okay? Okay, baby. What? I don't get a hello? You're back. What's it been this time? Like three whole months? That's not a hello. So, Nick, are you here on, uh, business or pleasure? Got a pretty big mouth to go with your big brain, huh? Leave her alone, Nick. And it's "dad", not Nick. I am your father. - Don't forget that. - Not like I haven't tried. This might break your heart, but blood is blood and blood is forever. Please. The only reason you keep mom around is to make this place your own personal stash house. Picking up, dropping off. Yeah? What do you know about that? She may cater to your needs, but we don't need anything from you. Better watch your mouth. Why don't you just take your shit and get the fuck out? - Take my shit? - Yeah. All of this is my shit!

Alex, it's just me. You okay? I want him gone. Alex… Mom, he just backhanded you across the face. He didn't mean to do that. No, he meant to hit me. No, he did not, but… did you really have to push his buttons like that? Tell him to go. Please, we don't need him. I need my husband. And like it or not, you still need a father. So, then why doesn't he need us? Relationships are built on things you go through together. When are you gonna stop letting him push you around? Is that really all you see? It's work. I gotta go.

Bright and early this morning. - Where you folks headed? - Uh, nothing to declare, sir. Sorry. We just came to do a bit of hiking, maybe some camping if the weather holds up. Okay, if I can just get your names for the register. Yes, sir. A few things to keep in mind before you move ahead. Stick to the clearly marked trails, campsites are marked off on the map. Just sign my name. Flying of drones and drone photography is strictly prohibited, as is the use of firearms. - All clear? - Yes. - Yes, sir. - Good. All set. Respect the rules of the park, and stay out of the restricted areas. - Can you see the falls from the river? - Yeah, you sure can, just follow the blue trail markers, you'll find it no trouble. Water table's a little high because of the storm, so steer clear. If you run into any trouble, just head on over to the ranger station, we'll sort you out. Great. Thank you. - Stay safe. Enjoy the park. - Thank you. That guy's definitely got a huge dick or something. Holy shit, man. If you let me drive, I can get us there a lot faster. No, you are not driving. I swear to God. My dad used to take me hunting here. It's really easy to get lost. What? He wasn't always a criminal psychopath. I had a childhood, you know. It's just, we never really hear you talk about him like that. Yeah, well, didn't say it was a long childhood. All right, come on, seriously. Give me the keys. Stop fucking around. Okay. Fine, but if you scratch it once… Then you'll have it looking new in no time, all right? So, don't worry about it. Fucker. And hey, I'll take care of Gam-Gam's car, all right now? - You better. - Oh, yeah. Please don't kill us. Don't be an idiot! All right, buckle up, people. Hi, there. How you folks doing today? Coming to take in the sights? Well, it's a beautiful day for it. Woo! Here you go, Bucko. There's no service. I'm over this already. Epic. Okay. Welcome to Vince's wild wilderness adventure! Come on. Let's go! - It's this way! - Okay. Hey, super trooper, you plan on waiting for the rest of us? Hold up! You want us to go in there? What's wrong? Big "no entry" sign doesn't give it away? That's for like animals and shit. Yeah, but only for the ones that can read. Hey, come here. Okay, let's go. I got you. Woo! Let's go. Come on. Let's go. - Come on. - Step it up. Hey, can we just… - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Do you need water? - No, it's okay. Sure. It's okay. You can finish it. Do you wanna go back? Back in time, maybe. I think I might be pregnant. Whoa. Like for real? Like for real. Well, did you take a test? No, but I'm late. Okay. But it could be something else. You don't know for sure. I'm supposed to go to the doctor next week. Don't suppose you'd come with me? Me? Yeah, of course, if you want. But… what about Vince? He doesn't know and you can't tell him. I'm serious. Swear. I swear. I don't know. Like, do I wait? And now he says he wants to join the army. The fucking army? Yeah, he did say that. And if I tell him, he's gonna think I'm trying to trick him into staying. Well… would you keep it? I work part-time as a coat check girl at the casino. What do you think? Hey! Hey! You guys gotta see this. Let's go. Come on. Woo! - I told you it'd be epic! - Holy shit! This is fucking crazy! I've never seen them from this high, or this close. This is insane! Jesse, you think I can make it? Maybe if you grew wings. You heard the ranger, water's way deeper now. Tell me you're fucking joking. - Vince. - Don't be stupid. You're not jumping. Vince, you would never make it, okay? Yeah, you'd die. - Don't do it. - Vince. - Vince, stop. - Vince! - Vince! - No, no, no. Don't do it. Woo! Oh, shit! All right. Yeah, that's pretty fucking high. Yeah, no shit. Okay, cut it out. - Vince! - Fucking stop. Stop! - Vince! Vince! - No, no, no! What the fuck? Fuck! - Vince? - Vince! Vince! There's no way. - Always playing games. - He's just messing with us. Well, he's an asshole. Vince! Vince? Vince! Do you think he went in and the current took him? - No way he jumped the falls. - Vince! He better not be fucking around. Vince! - Vince! - Vince! Vince! Vince! You scared the shit out of me! Not fucking funny, man. Where are you going? Oh, my God! Oh, nasty! I think it's recent, last night's storm maybe. No, no, no, no, no. You do not wanna go in there. Yeah, we should call the cops or tell the ranger. I mean, maybe no one even knows this is out here. Normally, that's what the transponder's for. No. No power. Shit. Em, what are you doing? Just in case someone asks. It's morbid. He's dead. Okay, geez. Vince, man, maybe you should get out of there. I don't think we oughta be touching any of this. Fuck you. I'm serious, man. We gotta go tell the ranger. Yeah, this doesn't feel right. You think there's a reward? Motherfucker. Is that… cocaine? Only one way to know for sure. What are you doing? - You can't do that. - Why not? So many fucking reasons that should be obvious to a normal human being. Let's all just relax, okay? Alex is right. We can't touch this. Do you have any idea how much one of these bricks are worth? Enough to put each of us away for a decade. - Do you see cops? - We're not drug dealers. And what about the dead body? I mean, that's a human being. We'll make an anonymous call later. Check it! This… This could set us up for a real fucking long time. It could literally change our lives. Em, you're not actually considering this? Not all of us are going away to some fancy school. School? - What's she talking about? - She didn't tell you? She's leaving you, dude, for some rich-ass college. Is this for real? No. I mean, it's not for sure. 'Cause that's why I didn't tell you. Without the scholarship… You can afford it now. - If we were to do this... - Em! Was I talking to you? How do we sell it? Uh, Jesse's got a weed guy, for sure there's a connection there. - No, leave me outta this. - You work at a casino. And then there's always Alex's daddy. Oh, do you want me to text him? Or take a sample home for Sunday night dinner? You're all crazy! I'm going to the cops. If you do, I'll tell them he was the one who put us up to it. - Yeah? - Yeah. What happens when he finds out? Hey, man, back off, okay? - Just give me... - I said back the fuck up! I'm taking mine! If you call the cops, I'll tell 'em about her daddy, so they'll have to investigate and puts her family under the microscope. - You're a fucking asshole! - So you keep telling me! Em, take her backpack. We get outta here, we go our separate ways. You forget you know us. No problem there. Go on. Ninety-nine. A hundred. A hundred and one. No? Okay. Hey, baldy. That's our car. You kids are out pretty far. No one else around for… miles. We were hiking. Swimming, too, by the looks of it. Tell me, what is so interesting… up over that hill? A waterfall. Beautiful. Mm. That all? - Yeah. - Nothing else? More trees? Look, buddy, we're on our way back to the ranger station, so, uh, could you get off our car? Fucking keep your mouth shut. Get the fuck out. Come on. We know we're in a restricted area, we're sorry. - If there's a fine... - Shut the fuck up. Jerry. You wanna come in? What's up, Cutter? Where you at? I'm up on that logging road. North of the pass. Found a couple of kids. Say they've been hiking near Migizi Falls. Yeah. I been searching up and down that river like twice. Well, maybe you missed something, Jerry, because these kids know more than they're saying. Yeah, all right. I'll be there in ten. Copy that. What's in the pack? - Camping gear. - Uh-oh. You said you were hiking. Hiking and camping. Look, we don't want any trouble. Honest, we were just hiking and... How 'bout you cut the shit, thank you, and you open the fucking bag. How 'bout that? What's the matter, sugar? You scared? What are you scared of? Come here. Leave her alone. You weren't here to hike, were you? Get the fuck away from her. Vince, what are you doing? Kid, I gotta hand it to you. I've had a lot of guns pointed at me in my life, but… …never a flare gun. Congrats. How about you put that fucking thing down before someone... You have to hit him again. We gotta go. Now! Em, come on. We can't help him now. Get in. Go! I just smashed a man's skull with a rock. Jesse, you saved us, okay? Do you know where we're going? The road we came from. Is anybody even listening to me? - I just smashed a man's skull. - You saved us. We have to go back. What if Vince is just hurt? We saw him get shot. - He's dead. - Alex, slow down. - Don't say that! - Slow down. Look out! Fuck, my leg. Ah, shit. Fuck. Em? Em? Emily! I'm fine. Hang on. Okay. Easy. Okay, show me your leg. Can you move it? It's okay. Just breathe. Is it bad? Looks fucking bad. No, you're gonna be okay. Just stay there. Hold still. Okay. Gonna hurt a little bit. Sorry. Em, are you okay? Do I look fucking okay? Look at me. Okay. How's the car? Um… Hold on. Jerry? Jerry, wanna call back? Jerry? Murph? Fuck. Someone fucking answer. Cutter, it's Murph. I heard gunshots. One of those little fuckers took a pop at me and fucked off. They know where the plane is. I found a couple bricks. Anything from Jerry? Nothing. He should've cut them off at the bottom of the logging road by now. I'm still at the clearing. You want I should go check it out? No. I'll head down and see what's going on as soon as I can see straight. Guys, we have to go on foot. Can you stand? - What about the pick-up? - It's trashed. Can't you fix it? Isn't that what you do? There's no time! Didn't you hear? Wait. The radio. Maybe I can get a emergency channel or something. Mayday. Mayday. Anyone there? - Mayday. Mayday. - Jesse, we need to get off the main road. And go where? We're in the middle of nowhere. We can't stay here and wait for that maniac to show up. Alex is right. We gotta keep moving. Okay. Okay. We gotta keep going. Come on. I can't, please. Okay, okay. Sorry. Okay, my leg's numb. I think it's broken. Let's not worry about that right now, okay? How bad? It's… it's bad. All right. Keep still. All right. That should help, okay? - We gotta go. - I just need a second. - We're never gonna make it out. - We'll make it. Em's right. You guys should go on without me. - We're not leaving you. - You mean like we left Vince? - That was way different, okay? - It doesn't matter! You guys need to find the ranger and bring him back here. We don't even know where here is. Vince was the one fucking driving! The map! The map! Where's the map? Vince had it in his backpack. I ditched the bags when we ran. They're still back there. Ah, shit! It's not far, okay? I can run and be back in like 20 minutes. Okay. Okay, go. Em and I will wait here. Just whistle or something in case you don't see us. No, no, no! Just go! Vince? Vince. Vince. Police, fire or ambulance? Police. Hi. Yeah, I need help. I'm in Garden Valley. Fuck. Hello? Hello? Ah! Climb down, or I start taking shots. I got more ammo than time. It's your choice. Fine. Have it your way. No, um, all right. Don't shoot. I'm coming down, okay? Smart girl. We were just hiking. I swear. Bullshit, we know you know where the plane is. Yes, but we found it by accident. We really only came to hike the falls. All right. That's better. Now, uh, which one are you? - Your name? - Alex. Okay, Alex. You're gonna take me to that plane, and in return, I'm gonna let you live. You understand? I need you to say it out loud. I'll take you to the crash site. Just, please don't hurt me. That's up to you. How far is it? Uh, it's close. All right. Start walking. Murph, they killed Jerry. - Looks like they ran off the road. - Jesus. All right, I'm here with one of the girls. - She's taking me to the plane now. - Good. Radio me your location as soon as you're there, and no loose ends, you hear me? Cutter, they're just kids, you know? Well, they saw our faces so they don't leave this forest. Is that clear? Murph? Yeah. Copy that. Murph out. Move. I don't see a plane. Hey! Better not be fucking around here. Down there. It's around a sandbank. I think you're lying! I swear. That's how we found it. I don't know another way. Well, how do you get down? Is there a path? What the fuck! Cutter, that crazy bitch just jumped the falls. Are you at the plane? No, no, no, she was gonna take me to the plane, and then she jumped the fucking falls! How 'bout you get the fuck after her? Get after her. Get after her. Okay. Fuck that! Hell no! Hey! Hey! You trying to get yourself killed? You gonna shoot me? I don't see a plane! Do it! Fuck! Cutter. The current's too strong. She must have drowned. What about the plane? Still no sign of it. Well, I've got the other two, so… we'll know soon enough. Copy that. They aren't going… anywhere. Need a little haircut? Just one or two? What about you, huh? Just a hair or two. Maybe. - You're alive. - Yeah. No thanks to any of you. But we looked for you. Hmm, I bet you looked real fucking hard. Where's Em And Jesse? Jesse hit that asshole with a rock, which only pissed him off, so we took off. Got real far I see. Jesse and Em are hiding down the road, but I went back to get the map and I ran into another one of them. Oh, the map's gone, along with everything else. How'd you get away? I jumped the falls. Like for real? - Like, like from the top top? - Yeah. You're fucking crazy. Oh. Ow. Fuck. Look, they're probably looking for me, so… Oh. You know, a please or a thank you would be nice. - You're such a dick. - Love you, too. Jesus! A little warning next time. Next dead body, promise. Who are you? That should hold. What are you doing? Give me the keys. Dream on, gimp. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? What the fuck did you think was gonna happen? I saw an opportunity and I took it. An opportunity for free drugs? World doesn't work like that. Yeah, well, my world doesn't work your way. At least you have options. Me, I'm… I'm another fucking Danny Hagel waiting to happen. That's not true. - You really need to talk to Em. - About what? Whoa. Look. Oh, fuck. Yes! Thank God you're here. There are these guys. They have guns. They're after us. They're drug runners or something. Whoa, slow down. Slowly. We heard the gunshots. We've already got patrols in the area. You're safe. What about Em and Jesse? Yeah, they're our friends. Emily and Jesse. Yeah, we know. We picked them up a while back. Yeah, we got them at the ranger station. They're getting all patched up. Come on. I'll take you to them. I think you need a call for back up, 'cause these guys are killers. We saw three of them, but there could be more. Oh, okay. Hold on. Yeah, I got the other two. I'll contact you from the ranger station. Over. Copy that. Over. You think you'd be able to… describe these guys if you saw 'em? Absolutely. One guy had some, uh... Come on, rise and shine. There she is. You ready to talk? Where am I? You're alive. Whether you stay that way is up to you. My friends? Where are my friends? Cutter, missy here wants proof of life. Copy that. Stop. Stop. Stop! Where's my plane, Alex? Fine. - I'll tell you. - No, you'll take me. And this time, we'll stay on dry land. You make one sound, I'll take one life. We clear? Crystal. We're looking at a lot of mudslides up there. If you're coming up from the north, I'd say you're looking at a lot of detours. And it's best to stay clear. Hi there. If you're looking for a day pass, you're outta luck. Park's closed for maintenance on account of last night's storm. I'm not here to sightsee. Well, then, what can I help you with? I'm looking for Skip. Hmm. Don't know no Skip. Something I can help you with? Sir? I was told I'd find Skip at the ranger station. Well, like I said, nobody's been by all day on account of last night's storm. Trails are pretty washed out. - Is that right? - Afraid so. But if your friend Skip shows up, I'd be happy to give her a message. I never said Skip was a her. - Lucky guess. - Yeah. Hands on the counter, now. Okay, we don't keep any money here. Shut the hell up. You bitch. That's on you. Nolan, come in. Been waiting on you. What's the hold up? Bit of a complication. You stay put. I'm coming to you. You had to be a rebel, huh? We're going for a ride. Keep moving. You're so fucked. Oh, is that so? When my dad finds out what you guys are doing, he's gonna cut you up into tiny little pieces. Mm, that's precious. Your daddy can't save you now. You just killed a Saint. Now you've one of their kids hostage. I'm talking to a dead woman. Nice bluff, kid. I'll take my chances. Get in. Get in! Nolan, come in. Change of plans. A Saint showed up. Had to do what I had to do. - Jesus Christ. - Couldn't be helped. - You had to? - Now, this changes things. I'd say that's a major fucking understatement. We can still get ahead of this. Gotta move fast before more show up. I'm on my way to the plane now. I'll radio a location when I'm there. And what about the kids? You know, just keep them breathing. After that, you can give them to Cutter. Man, this is fucked up. There's a way you can still get out of this. You take me to that plane, I'll let you go. Simple as that. Maybe I'll even let your little boyfriend keep his leg. Hey! This can hurt… just as well as kill. Do you understand me? Good. Now, where are we headed? Just around the bend. See how easy that was? Shit! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Big mistake! I'm gonna make it real slow and painful for your friends. First, I'll do missy. And then I'll set your boyfriend on fire, just a little bit at a time… until the forest fills with the smell of burning flesh. Tune in if you don't believe me. It's up to you. Cutter, don't lay a finger on those brats 'til you hear from me, are you clear? Wouldn't dream of it. - Leave him alone! - What's the matter with you? You feeling left out, huh? - I'm pregnant! - Hey! You heard what Skip said. They're just kids. Yeah. You're right. Little kiddies, huh? This one smashed my fucking head in with a fucking rock! Hey. Hey. You take orders from me, not the other way around. You understand? You get that? Yeah, I gotcha. Good. Hey, guys, I'm feeling generous today. So, tell you what. I'm gonna let one of you… …go free. And the best part is, you get to decide… who it is. Or I can decide for you. What do you say? Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be? What are you doing? Uh oh. Cock it. Em, he's lying. He's not gonna let you go. I'm sorry. No. - I'm sorry. - No. Oh. Please. Please, don't! Oh. At least we know which one of you has balls. How about another round, huh? I don't know about you, but I could do this all day. Here. Take it again. Quit fucking around, Cutter. If the little bitch doesn't show up, we're gonna need one of these two. We're losing daylight here. I'm just saying. Yeah, well, this isn't over. And I'm not leaving empty handed. My money's on that old mine dump, huh? I say we send Murph out there again. There's ten miles of bush-whacking between here and the dump. Fuck this. The Saints are on the way, it's getting dark. Either she takes us to the plane, or we're done. We're done when I say we're done. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Now, who's ready for some fireworks, huh? Fuck. No. Oh, fuck. Maybe then she'll talk, yeah? No. No, no. No. No, no, no. No. Please! Please! ♪ All the good times Have passed and gone ♪ ♪ All the good times are over ♪ ♪ All the good times Have passed and gone ♪ ♪ Darling, don't you weep for me ♪ ♪ Oh, don't you see That passenger train ♪ ♪ Coming around the bend ♪ ♪ It's taking me away From this lonesome hotel ♪ ♪ Never to return again ♪ ♪ All the good times Have passed and gone ♪ ♪ All the good times, oh ♪ ♪ All the good times Have passed and gone ♪ Move and I cripple you for life. Okay. Okay. I figured you'd be long gone by now. That's wishful thinking. - Try that again… - Fuck! - …I put a bullet in your ear. - All right. Fuck! Yeah. Yeah. You are fucked, 'cause the Saints are coming and no way they're gonna let you live after you fucked up this bad. Didn't realize you and the Saints were so tight. We are. So what? You really think they're gonna trade me for your friends? They'd sooner kill me right along with you. There's a way we all get out of this alive, provided you help me. Why the fuck would I help you? Because my guess is you're in this for the pay day, not to kill a bunch of kids. We already know what your life's worth to Skip. Well, if it came down to them or me… It's definitely them. You have no idea what you're up against. Move. Move! Axe. Still not getting through to Griz, just his last text, that was it. - Could be bad reception. - Yeah, could be, could be. Could be something else. How do you wanna handle it? You know, if you want something done right… All right, boys. Come in, kid. I know you're out there. Thirty seconds and I start putting holes in people. Looks like your little girlfriend cut out and ran. Fuck you! I'd stay off that if I were you, huh. You should see his face right now. Any he last words for your little fucking boy toy, hmm? Or maybe he's not the one you're worried about. Alex, run! Do you hear me? Enough. There's our girl. I'll take you to your drugs. But first, you let Jesse and Em go. Counteroffer. I kill one. You take us to the plane. And then after that, maybe I'll let the other one go. The Saints are already on their way. Adding a couple kids to your body count will only make things worse. Family's funny that way. I'm listening. Once they're on the main road, I'll take you to the plane. - I'll go. - Not him. What's the matter, sweetie? You afraid of the big bad wolf, huh? Come near me and I kill you! Where's Murph? He's off taking a piss. Nolan'll go with you. As soon as he sees the plane, I'll let the others go. Are you seriously gonna let a fucking kid call the shots like this? Cutter, shut the fuck up. That wasn't the deal. The best one you're gonna get. Put Jesse on the radio. Alex, you okay? As soon as you can, you get the hell out of there. Do you understand me? I'm… I'm not leaving you. Just do it. I'll take the other guy. Goddamn. I kept up my end. Tell Skip to let them go. Not just yet. Now, start tossing out bags. I'm not playing around here. Drop it. Backstabbing little rat. That's a compliment, coming from you. This is taking too long. Nolan? Nolan, what's the hold up? Skip, she's got it. She's gonna burn it. Nolan? You're not the only one who likes to play with matches. Little bitch. You touch Jesse or Em… and I burn it. All of it. Let them go. What the hell you talking about? We don't need 'em, besides they won't get far. You heard her. Let's go! Get the fuck out. Come on! Be seeing you real soon. All right, they're gone. Put my guy back on. The plane's at the bottom of the falls, about 40 yards in behind a hidden bend. Follow the logging road till you come to your jeep. Hey Skip, I'd hurry if I were you. I just… I just need a second. Alex, are you there? We're on the logging road. Jesse's hurt really bad. I don't know how much further we can make it. Em, I'm here. Thank God. About Vince, um… What? You're sorry? Stay where you are, okay? I'm gonna… I'm gonna find you. - Come on. - Okay. Okay. We're here. This better not be some kind of fucking trick. Might wanna tell your boy to keep still. Murph found that out the hard way. Don't move, Cutter. Just stay put. She can't cover us both. Smart ass. Drop it. You're a tough little cunt, aren't ya? Probably not tough... You should probably stay off of that. Good for you, kid. Are you gonna finish me? Think I just did. Bam. You fucker! Oh, you fucking son of a bitch! Fuck! Let's go get Jesse and Em. Don't worry. They can't be too far. You get what I asked for? Shit. Fuck. Both of you. Out. Uh-uh! No! Hi, Dad. Hello. These belong to you? Let them go. Hmm, thought we were negotiating here. Your drugs and the others are waiting for you about a quarter mile back. Just follow the smoke. Hmm. And him? He helped me out. I'm alive because of him. No. No, little girl, you're alive because of me. You know, I put up with a lot of shit growing up, but I'm done. - Watch it. - Why? You gonna hit me? Like you hit mom? I bet you think the whole world is pretty black and white, don't you? I'm willing to guess there's a lot more of the old man in you than you're willing to admit. Maybe. But just in case, I uploaded a shit ton of incriminating evidence from Skip's phone to the Cloud. Anything happens to us, it all gets released. You can go. Next time, get your boys to lock their phones. No, no, no. Not him. That's… He was… He chose this, and I'm not asking. It's okay, Alex. He's right. See you around, Nick. Let's go. Leave him. Oh. I'll be seeing ya. Probably. Your transcripts are clearly impeccable. It's obvious you were diligent in your studies. Thank you. But we like to get to know each candidate on a more personal level. It helps to give us a sense of what kind of contribution we can expect from our serious students. Character counts. Of course. So, then, could you please tell us about a time in your life that best exemplifies a moment where you had to overcome adversity, and how that experience has gone on to shape the person that you are today?
