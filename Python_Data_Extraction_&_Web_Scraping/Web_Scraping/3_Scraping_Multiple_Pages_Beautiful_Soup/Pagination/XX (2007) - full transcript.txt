Seriously, Aiko, how many people are you going out with? Three... Wait, four? Do you really like all those guys? Sort of, I guess. "Sort of," huh... I don't want to be hurt the way you were, Shiyori. What's that mean? "Sort of" is the best for not getting hurt. You put a suitable distance between each other and don't get hurt. Hey, does that include me too? Does what? Is my being here a "sort of" thing for you too? What? Come on, why are you getting all serious? Watch out! Ouch... Come on... Come on... Hey! Snip, snip, snip..- Snip, snip, snip..- Hell...

Welcome to Ashikari Village Thank you for coming from so far. Even though it's this deep in the mountains, it's such a nice inn. The whole village got together and built it to welcome our guests. The whole village? For generations, they have been woodcutters. About how many people are living here in this village? Excuse me? Yes? That's why. So the ones left are only old folks like myself. Keiichi Asamiya I will leave the yukatas over here. May I serve dinner after your bath? Yes. The hot spring is very relaxing. Please clean your legs very well. We came to some place, huh? The place doesn't really matter. As long as it's far away from him. Is it really over now? Can't you let go of him cheating once? You wouldn't understand, Aiko. Understand what? It's because you've never cried over someone before. You've gone out with so many people. I don't want you to understand how I feel. He was my first boyfriend... So what? I'm going to go back to the room. Hello? It's me. Shiyori got out of the bath just now, so... Yeah, everything is as planned. Shiyori, I want to talk one more time. Please answer. - Keiichi Wait, Shiyori! Shiyori! Hello? Why... won't... you... answ... Get out of there! U-Um, excuse me... Leg... chopped... Akira Mononobe Hurry up and get out of there! They're going to chop your leg off! How was the bath? It was lovely. Please have dinner before it gets cold. When you are done, please inform us with the house phone. Thank you very much. Hello? What's the matter? Did something happen? No, not really... Get out of there right away. If you're caught by them, you'll be sacrificed! Um, is this a prank? This cell phone... It's not mine. Who are you? I'm... I'm... You're not Shizuka? No, I'm not. You're not Shizuka? Why... Why do you have my sister's cell phone? I came to this hot spring with a friend and found this phone in the closet. That can't be... Then Shizuka was already... What's going on? What happened? The room lights all of a sudden... Really... They finally... Who do you mean by "they"? Who are you? What's the meaning of this? Miss, were you able to clean your legs very well? Regarding the power outage, please don't worry. We will come by right away, so... It's okay. I'm going to bed now. I'll be sacrificed? What do you mean by that? Even if I talk to you about this, I don't know if you'll believe it... Please just tell me. I'm Akira Mononobe. I'm studying ethnology at Jounan University. Ethnology? Yeah. In ancient Japan, there was a custom to sacrifice young women to the gods in order to ward off catastrophes. In Ashikari Village too, where you are... From the beginning, Ashikari was a village of woodcutters. While the men were away chopping trees from mountain to mountain, in order to make sure the women didn't run off, the men chopped off the women's left legs. That was the start of the horrible custom. As time went on, the villagers captured traveling women and worshipped them as living gods to offer to the mountain. The women that were turned into living gods had their left legs cut off and were imprisoned in a small mountain shrine. As for that custom, it's being quietly practiced to this day. All the villagers were dragging their legs, right? When children are born, they cut the tendons in their left legs. As proof of association, but also to keep them from escaping the village. Impossible! I can understand how you don't want to believe it. But you must've seen it too. The scarecrows posted all over the village... Those aren't decorations. They mummified the women who died and worship them as guardians of the village. Be careful. The ritual has already started. We've brought you some lights. Dark places are dangerous. Please open the door, miss. What's wrong? Hey, what's going on? Hello? Hello? Hello... Please tell me your name. It's Shiyori Mizuno... Shiyori... I want to help you. You can believe my story or get your leg chopped off by them. You only have one of those two choices! Hello? Hello? Mr. Mononobe! Please hold on! Is there something wrong? If you're not going to open it, I'll use my key and come in! Why aren't you answering, Aiko? It's an emergency. Contact me as soon as possible. - Shiyori Out of range Please, Aiko, answer... Please... Receiving... Crisis! I'm waiting at the restroom at the hot spring. - Aiko Akira Mononobe Mr. Mononobe? What's the situation? I managed to get out of the inn area. Did you bring the map of the village? Did you bring the map of the village? Yes... The main entrances and exits are most likely already covered. It's a little far, but there's an old tunnel towards the east end. Please wait for me there. I'm heading there with my car right now. I understand. By the way, I want to ask you something important. How did you find out about Ashikari Village? From a friend in the same club... Her name is Aiko... She invited me to go to a hot spring with her... I have to go save Aiko... How did she find out about Ashikari Village? She said she looked it up online... It's dangerous... As far as I researched, there is no information about Ashikari Village on the Web. That can't be... Then Aiko is... She might be working with them too. Hello? Listen, Shiyori. It's important for you to stay alive and get out of that village.

Ashikari Village There are no matching pages. There are no matching pages. What that Mononobe guy said is true, What that Mononobe guy said is true, but there is no basis on which to believe him either. The cell phone you're using now... You don't really know if that girl named Shizuka actually exists or not. But... Anyway, I'll contact the police. I'll look into that guy named Mononobe too. Thank you. Also, it's kind of hard to say this, but you should watch out for Aiko too. What do you mean? I'm not too fond of her... To tell you honestly, I don't really trust her. Shiyori, you;re too nice. I'm sure there are times when you're betrayed, but just believe in yourself and do your best. I actually want to go save you, but with my body the way it is now... I'm sorry. Don't be. To Aiko.

Shiyori Mizuno Final Chapter: The Pair's Cell Phones at X Cross Akira Mononobe Hey, Shiyori, please listen... The one who set up our breakup was actually Aiko. Apparently, there was a girl from work who had feelings for me, and she asked Aiko to break up our relationship. It totally fooled me. Then the one you were kissing back then was... Wait, Shiyori! It was Aiko. Are you serious... I wanted to get back with you somehow, so I left it to Aiko, and she set it up here. Then the one who chose this village really was... Yeah, it was Aiko.

All the while in your mind, I was a stupid girl for being so down, right? No! Stop making fun of me already! You also knew all about the village's secret, right? What are you talking about? Stop trying to play dumb. You murderer. Shiyori, I'll protect you. Starting now and forever. Hello? Aiko, listen, it's something urgent. Akira Mononobe Hello? What's wrong? I wasn't able to reach you for a while. Are you okay? Mr. Mononobe, who are you anyway? My friend looked into it for me. Apparently, your name isn't in the student registry for Jounan University. So that's it, huh? But you definitely said you were from Jounan... I'm an instructor. Did you check the instructor registry too? No way... Welcome to Ashikari Village Hey, Asamiya, that was... Shiyori, please listen. This is new information. I found out the name of the guy who brought my sister to that village. The guy's name is Keiichi Asamiya. He's a former inhabitant of Ashikari.
