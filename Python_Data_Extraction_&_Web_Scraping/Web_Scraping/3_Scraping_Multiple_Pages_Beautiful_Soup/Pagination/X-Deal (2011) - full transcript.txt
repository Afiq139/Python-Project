There are things money can't buy. Nonsense. One big figurative nonsense. Why would the world stop for an outdated ideology? Why? Is money the only way to acquire something? Why not trade? Why choose money if the prospect of the trade is so thrilling? For example, an epic merchandise for an epic commodity. Or a monumental necessity for an intense pleasure. Things that make the blood flow and arouse the mind. Like sex, drugs and rock n' roll. Drugs and rock n' roll can easily be traded on the spot or with a simple exchange by hand. There are only two rules. You can't return it, and you can't take it back. When it comes to sex, that's another story. But, there are things that might not be impossible but hard to compete with. However, like an old saying. Everything has a price. Even if something can’t be bought with money, it can be paid with something else worthwhile. Whatever it is, whoever it is. The house rules here are simple, sir. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. In a simpler term, mind your own business. Don’t bother others' lives. That’s better. Are the tenants here okay? Yeah, they’re okay. They pay on time. That’s the usual problem of caretakers like me, when tenants fail to pay two to three months, we’re already planning on kicking them out. You'll find the wall that should be painted on it but there's no budget. Dana. Let’s go. Welcome, ma’am, sir. Yes. Here, darling. Spend it well, my dear girl. It’s really hard to get those. Because of the global warming? Because of the law of supply and demand. Good thing you’re not running out. As long as I have patrons in Baguio, expect that there’s grass. I give them narc, they give me corolessence of Mary Jane. Home-grown shit darling. Groceries, latex paint, resin, medium sized horse paper maché, and seven dildos? Groovy. I have a question. Go. Violet, green, red, light blue. Why are the dildos color-coded? They are the colors of the seven deadly sins. Hmm, okay. I love it when I spend quality time with my mother, for one, her brand of wisdom never fails to enlighten me. Well today, I learned about colors: violet is pride, green is for envy, wrath is red. Do what you need to do. Sloth, light blue. Greed is yellow. Gluttony, orange. Lust, the greatest of all sins is dark blue. I'll never look at the rainbow the same way again. Shit! Toto! To! I need you upstairs, come here fast. Okay. Your framing is perfect. You should’ve asked permission first. Sorry, you might get conscious. Candid shots are far better. Is that a toy? This? Lomo camera. Hmm, so you’re a Lomo-freak? Yeah, I’m into Lomography. By the way, I’m Billy. I’m Dana. Lomography? What’s the difference between that and Kodak or Canon? As far as I know, Kodakology or Canonigraphy doesn’t exist. It’s hard to explain. You should see the photos so you can easily understand it. So, do you have an on-going one-man exhibit there in your unit? I have. Am I invited? Of course. Now? Up to you. Hey, Dana, what’s the problem? My TV is broken, fix it. Okay. Where the fuck. Oh yeah. Hi, I’m Dana. I live beside your unit. Dana, come in. She’s Sarah, my girlfriend. Hi. She wants to see the photos. Okay, nice to meet you. I’m going. - See you. - Bye. She’s from theater production. She shows up in movies sometimes. Actress? Yup. Wow. Yeah. Let’s go, I’ll show you the photos. Okay. Let’s go. The emphasis of Lomography is to take casual and candid photographs to document everyday life. The more the approach is light-hearted, the more spontaneous it becomes. Anything goes, just click away. Actually, the blurring and the off compositions make the photograph. Look. Why use a saleslady as a subject? Nothing, just for fun. How about you, what keeps you busy? Blogging. Blogging? I get an average of five thousand hits per day. Ads are enough to make a living. Wow. So, how do you make a living with Lomo? That’s only a hobby. Non-profit shit. So, when can I see my picture? Ah, soon, soon. Maybe tomorrow or next week. Okay, I’m going back to my place. - Okay. - Thank you for the Lomo lecture. No problem, see you around. Okay. Oh, Dana, your TV is working already. The only thing that’s broken is its fuse. You’re so great, To, let me kiss you! Wait. Okay, okay. Here. Thanks. - By the way, thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Miss, are you going out? Yes, sir. Are you a saleslady? Yes. Ladies’ wear? Ladies’ underwear. What is the brand of your panties? Do you want to see it, sir? Hi, are you going to work? Yeah. You too. No, I’m just going to accompany her to the car. Hi, may I borrow a blank CD? I’ll give it back tomorrow. - Is it okay? - Sure, come in. Here. Thanks. Anything else? Let’s have sex? Fucking idiot. How can you be so stupid? She’s wet, she just took a bath, and you just let her go! Idiot! Here, this belongs to a boxer who was beaten up. Dana! And this- Is there anything else you need? DVD-R? This is CD-R. Do you have any? None. To, next time bring some. Okay, all right. Okay, I’ll just use this. Okay. So that’s yours and this is mine. Hello, mom. I know, I know. Whatever you say, mom. You’re the boss. Yes, mom, I already saw the unit. It’s small but it’s okay. I'll call you back. Yes, later, later. All right, mom. Love you. Hmm, just the right shapes and colors. You didn't mess with them, did you? I still prefer all natural. Oh, yeah. So… left or right? They said, never feed two mouths with the same hand. Have you ever been in love? Of course, your question is cheesy, but yes, of course. With whom? With your father. Really? Would you come out of my vagina if I did not love your father? I thought I was just a product of a one-night-stand? Be proud, dear, you were a product of a long and meaningful night. Were you in love with him that time? Not yet. But the day after that, I fell for him. Your father gave me the best fuck a girl could ever have. It’s either I fall too easily or he’s too easy to be loved. Was he your first? Okay. Let’s say that I am a Virgin Mary or you are the Immaculate Conception. Still… Darling, sometimes we do things even without a deep thought. Just a simple desire, just a simple lust. Is it worth it? Lust that turned to love? Worth it. Let’s play. And who am I supposed to be right now? Tomboy? So, we're not gonna have sex? Because I'm a tomboy, right? Well, that's why it's so exciting, I can play rough with you. So, you're gonna hurt me first before you fuck me? If you agree. You fucking perv. Try me. Doesn't mean I'm playing with you, you can't just hurt me like that. I'm gonna have you locked up. Dammit! You’re too fussy! Mom? Mom! Mom? Mom! Do you have an extra candle? Yeah, come in. Give me a minute. What were you thinking? Did you think I was here to send you a signal? Is there anything else? Fuck you! I’m aiming for your girlfriend. Give that to me. Even your briefs are green. Sir, you were looking for me? Yes, dear. It’s about your grades, they’re failing, let’s make it better. Good morning! Pervert Lomographer! At least I'm honest about my feelings. So, you like Sarah. I can’t blame you, she’s one hot babe. Yeah, I like her. And so? You like her, I like you. Sounds like a fair trade. Fuck you! Seriously, sleep with me, you can have your night with Sarah. Trust me, it’s all worth it. You know what? I have a better idea, jump off the building and then say, “My briefs are green!” So, Dana is a lesbian. She admitted it. You got along with her pretty fast. So, how did it happen? "Hi, I'm Dana, I'm a lesbian." "And I'm Billy, I'm a closet maniac." You are her type. Dumbass, you jealous? No. But I have an idea… And what’s that? I told you that I want you to role play as a tomboy, right? I just thought that we can actually change the concept of our playtime, but this time, we’ll do it for real. I’ll have sex with Dana in exchange for you. She already agreed. Idiot! Crazy! So, you think I will agree? It's just a game. So, our relationship is all just a game, too? So, I’m your type? As a matter of fact, yes. My question is simple, I don’t need your poetry. Want to do it, or not? Yes. Well then, let me join your game. You guys talk about whoever goes first. I’ll get going, I have a rehearsal to attend. And you agreed? Don’t you want me to? When will I get my orders? Later. Okay, take care. Mom’s so annoying, she wants me to go back to the States, but I don’t want to. I prefer to stay here. Girls are more beautiful here. I’ll get it, bro. No, it’s okay. Dana. Wait for a while, bro. All right. Okay, game. Tomorrow at eight in the morning, in my unit. Me and Sarah will do it first, then after a week, it’s our turn. You agreed? Why, don’t you want me to? Sarah doesn’t even care. She said that we’ll do the scheduling. Really? By the way, why do we have to wait for a week? Is it wrong to let my vagina rest? Ah okay, one week. Got it. My mom is heading from the States and will be arriving tomorrow. You should go shopping. You can buy some new clothes. Oh. Now, tell me. You wanna play my game? What kind of theme do you want? A nursing student? A Saleslady? A college prostitute? Or my favorite, a blind virgin? Huh? Don’t you have any fantasy character? Just tell me, I’m willing do it. You know, I want you, the real you. Ah, bad actress who is into method acting. Okay, see you later. Here it is. Thank you. Thank you also! - Okay, Toto. Thank you. - Till next time. Do you know the consequence of this? Yeah. I mean, no. Are you scared? A bit. Yes. Well, Billy’s no serial killer, but he’s different. I’m sure he’ll make you pay for this. You know, you’re the most aggravated person here. Like what I asked you in the elevator, why did you agree? At first, I was shocked. But then, I realized that between me and Billy, he’s been honest about what he really feels. How can you say that? Well, I guess, when there’s no love in the relationship, there’s something else that you can hang on to. Like what? A good fuck. Billy was just taking it a notch higher. Oh, okay. And now, it’s his turn. Whatever happens, your end of the deal is to be his sex partner for one night. Nothing more, you don't need to satisfy him. Are you jealous? Nope. The truth is, I want you to enjoy. Let him do all the work. What if I didn’t like it? Then follow the tip for soon-to-be rape victims. What is it? Play dead, until the predator loses its appetite. In many ways, we take part in a trade. We do it while we taunt fate and mess with it. Sometimes, we end up short changed, bruised, and a wreck. People say we trade our souls to the devil whenever we give in to our sinful desires. We wallow in its carnal bliss, we laugh, we moan, we scream, we bleed. Sooner or later, we'll just have to deal with the consequence. I say it's a fair trade. Who’s your source? Huh? Shit. - Hello? - Fuck you all! Hi. Hi, hon, yup. Someone’s watching TV. Here, with my friends. Yeah. Is it loud? I’m sorry, I’ll drop by there after this, I’m just doing something. Yes? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. So, you’re home? Oh, no? I’ll just bring something for you, don’t worry. Sure. Love you, love you. Okay, I’m just doing something. - Love you. Bye. - You really don’t want to talk, huh? Who’s your source? Who’s your source? - What the heck? - What do you want? Fingers? Thank you. You’re actually really fussy. I’m kind. I changed the color for you. Faster! What are you doing? Idiot! Let me go! It hurts! Let me go! You’re a rapist, idiot! - No! I'm not a rapist. - He raped me! - We had a deal! - How dare you? You’re a rapist! No, I'm not, I'm not a rapist! You’re an animal! How dare you? We had a deal! - Bring him out! - Let me go! I’m not a rapist! - I didn’t do anything wrong! We had a deal! - Don’t believe him! He’s a liar! Sarah, tell them I'm not a rapist. Tell them we had a deal. Sarah! Sarah! Tell them. Sarah! Dana! I’m innocent, let me go! Sarah! - What the fuck? - Don’t let me go to jail for this! Guys, those bitches are lying. - You were caught in the act! - Sarah! Sarah! Hello, chief, the raid is negative. There’s no evidence here. Yes, chief. Enough, it’s over. Don’t worry, everything’s gonna be okay. I’ll be pulling the group out. All right. Everybody go back to your units. - Sir. Yes, sir. - Make sure that everything’s clear. We’ll be pulling out. Enough. Sir, at the police right now. Let’s go.
