If he tells the cops, we will adjust this matter under him, and then our goose is ready. Why are you so afraid? We ask them to rob the place, and then call the police. Do you think it will be bought at the police? Nobody would believe Ben. He has a criminal record. No court declares him guilty. Really. Mays Ben a job of work for you. - Really? - Of course. Let's talk. Come out for tea. - Over tea? - Yes. Come on, Lee. Sure. We'll talk. Hey, shut the door. Mei, what do you think he will do with us? I do not know. Can he give up.
