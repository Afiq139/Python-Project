Mr. Ma. Great, it's settled. Bye. Please. Mr. Ma. Mr. Ma. They are... They own the Third Electrical and Computer Factory. You said you wanted to buy off their business, they'd like to speak to you. Ask the manager Mr. Chen to talk to them. But Mr. Chen said it's a big deal. I know. You tell Mr. Chen he can be in charge for any deal as long as it doesn't exceed eighty million. Send Mr. Ho in. Sure. This way please. Alright. Mr. Ma. Why did the communications equipment reach the South China Oil field only yesterday? The container ship passed through Persian Gulf, it got delayed because of the war going on there. In that case, can we finish according to the date on the contract? I need one more week. Can't. You must finish on time. If you want to finish on time, we need two extra crews to set things up. That would cost another $500,000. If we get an extension, we'll be fined by the Oil Company 20,000 a day, we'll need to pay a total of $140,000. Trust has brought Hou Ma Enterprise to where it's today tell the engineering department to finish on time. Sure. What other appointments do I have? You'd meet Executive Councilor Mr. Jones at three, and the Manager of Schick Bank would like to ask you to join him for golf at five. I turned him down for you, because Mr. Jones would like to invite you to a fashion show tonight. Director Huang of Po Leung Kuk wants to speak to you. Do I need to entertain them? I guess it would help. Very well, pass the line. Director Huang? There isn't any problem about the donation. Certainly, I'll donate five hundred thousand. You're too kind. It's the least I could do for the kids. Alright... take care, bye. What's your problem? The show's about to start. Why are you so late? Time is running out! Stop it! Step on the gas. I waited almost an hour for you. I know. That's why I was late. You're doing this on purpose? You don't need to pick me up, I could always get a cab. Fine, next time you drive. You know better that I don't have a car, there's no need to be so sarcastic. You just need to nod and there are many who'd gladly give you their cars. Too bad I can only say no. How's that possible? Yours. For me? What now? Just a favour. I did my share to get you where you are in the modeling world. Yes you helped me, but I don't really owe you anything. Come on! We're friends here. Just tell me what's on your mind. Open it. It's fancy. That means it's not from you. I can't afford it. A rich man did. Spend some time with him, as if you're with me. A Patek Philippe watch with 24 diamonds, I wouldn't give such a gift to my wife no matter how much she begs. Very well, tell your wife to sleep with him then. Hey! You broke it. My wife wouldn't go. Thank goodness. You wanna kill yourself? Dam n. Sorry. Have you eaten? Not yet. Take it. And you? - I've eaten. - Alright. Is my eye-shadow alright? Put a little bit more on this side. Oops, where's the other pad? I put it here a while ago. Where is it? I need it now, who took it? How can I go out without it? Put a papaya inside. Then she'll be bigger than yours. Better than no figure. Let me see. Go to hell! Village bike. You're yelling at me? You're nuts! You took my pad as an ashtray? And you call me nuts? What's that got to do with me? I didn't know who put it here. Bitch with a big mouth! And you've a big ass, why don't you go sell your ass? Look at her! How could she? That means everyone could have a ride. Whoever calls me a village bike again, I'll rough her up. Village bike. You. Tina isn't here yet? She's on her way. What's the matter with her? We only have ten minutes before the show, why isn't she here? Chill out, Stella. She's a top model. What? Top model? If she pisses me off, I wouldn't hire her again. No wonder everyone says you're a fair boss. Stella, this doesn't fit me. Then try out Tina's. Sorry, Stella. I'm late. Don't worry, still have ten minutes. You're experienced, shouldn't be a problem. Put some makeup on. Forget it, Mary. Wear it in the next show. She should be an actress. Why are you so late? Bad luck, I bumped into a pimp. Mr. Ho? Yes. Don't you know how Stella is? She talked behind your back. Well, I'm used to it. Mr. Ma, welcome. Over there. Mr. Luo. Hello... Mr. Ma, Chairman Lin has been waiting for you. Hello, Mr. Jones. Mr. Ma, it's nice to see you. Mr. Li, you're here so early? You know I'm a fan of fashion shows. Enjoy the show, excuse me. Simon, how come you're so late? Got held up by the Light Rail project in Tuen Mun; The worst is, I don't know what the Government blueprint is like, I daren't buy off those houses there for development. When you have become a Councilor, then you'd know everything. But there's no news regarding that so far. I've set it all up, that's why he'd like to meet you. If there's anything else I could do, please tell him to let me know. Stella. Yes? Is Tina here? She's changing. You know how snotty she is! So? He said you're qualified, the council has recommended you, all we need is the Governor's signature. The Governor asked them the other day why you're still not married. In order to have a political career, it's better if you're married. I'm pissed when I see her face. Calm down, I'll help you out. It's better if you're married. Hurry»- Who hid my shoes? Look! She's doing this on purpose. Don't worry, we'll get even. Zhen, so you hid my shoes. It's not my problem, Shark told me to keep them. Why are you so mean? You told Zhen to hide my shoes? What is it to you? You get changed faster than Rosa. Rosa? Yes, she used to be a top model. Famous for changing clothes quickly. I've heard. But she's no longer a top model. She was so full of herself, she even ignored Mr. Ho. It's all over for her. Young people are like that. What's wrong with some social gatherings? Just communications! You can't say that. I'm here as a model, not some hooker. So? Chairman Lin, do you see anyone you like? Let me take a good look. You like the black or the white? Neither, introduce to Mr. Ma. What do you think, Mr. Ma? Pick one. There's no need, I want her. Very well, I'll set it up. That bitch was trying to knock me off the ramp. You know they're friends. So? Bite me. I really wanted to kick her off the catwalk. Forget it! We're doing proper shows. Fine! I'll have my chance. Tina, Mr. Ma would like you to join him for dinner. I'm tired. Mr. Ma is a successful businessman. In that case, pass it to Shark. He wants to date me? In your dreams. So, Tina? Refuse again? That's right. I think we have some misunderstandings, let's have a good chat. We have nothing to talk about. That's exactly why we should talk. Sorry, I need to go eat with Mr. Ma. He's taking you out? You don't have the caliber. Can't even lie, what's the point with the act? If he's asked you on a date, what are you doing here? It's not that difficult to be sitting in a Rolls Royce. Follow my lead and earn as much as you can while you're still young. Very well, if you don't believe me I could go with you, but you need to explain to him. Go. Mr. Ma. Where's Tina? Sorry, she twisted her ankle. So? I'd rather piss off Mr. Ma, but I won't dare to offend you. Very well. You think you're really something, huh? Careful! When you fall I'll be there to laugh at you. Go buy some clothes. Thanks, I'll set up another date tomorrow. That's fine, she's here. Tina. Mr. Ma. So? How's your ankle? She's fine now... hop in. Mr. Ma, you're so charismatic. Stella, I told you to set it up, I didn't invite you. No... I wanted to bring you here. This is really formal. This is a fund raising party for the International Foundation for the Physically Challenged. The Governor will be here soon. Chairman Ma, hello. You've brought a date. What's the occasion? Come on, let's have a chat. Please. Enjoy yourself. Hello. What a party! Tina, what a surprise! You look beautiful, let's sit over there. Alright. Who's she? Chairman Ma's girlfriend. I think she's a model. Sit down, what a lovely shawl. Thanks. I'm surprised that Chairman Ma brought you. I haven't seen him with a date in public. You flatter me Miss, any drink? Mint liqueur Thanks. Guess he must like you a lot. Why did you bring me here? It has a good view. I'm afraid that I've climbed too high. Shall we get married? Sorry? Shall we get married? Married? Sure. I'm busy tomorrow, how about the day after? I'll ask Mr. Jones to be our witness. Sure. Come pick me up in a bridal car then. Ok. Miss Bai. I wonder if you're interested to be Mrs. Ma. Are you serious, Simon? The bridal car is waiting. This is your size, put it on. Come look. What? They gave you a chamber pot Must be from Peter. We'll make tea for him with it when he's over. Good idea. What's this? What's this? Chastity belt. Yuck. Your friends all gave you really strange presents. What a lovely necklace. Look. You're entitled for something better than pearls, I'll give you a diamond necklace one day. Really? You're Mrs. Ma from now on. You should be prepared. I know, there will be lots of socializing. TV shows, speeches, ribbon cuttings, even representing me on the board's meetings. Then I will be super busy? That's why I'd like to ask you a question, hope you won't mind. Of course not, we're a married couple. What's your sex drive like? Strong, average or low. Average. I think, sex is only a part of married life. Good, I'm glad you think that. I'm not particularly keen on sex, but intensely passionate towards other things. Meaning? As Mrs. Ma, you can have anything you want, except sex life. You'd still be very happy, get it? You'll get used to it. Good night. You're not dressed yet? I'm not feeling well. It's a very important party. The Governor will be there, you must go. Put on some make up, go on. Wear this one, it's more graceful. Mrs. Ma, the new stock hasn't arrived yet. That's fine, I just want to buy that dress I saw last time. Sure. Is this the one, Mrs. Ma? Yes. But Mrs. Chen, Miss Liang and Mrs. Zhou all bought one, would you mind? Of course not, I just need to put this in my wardrobe. Okay. Right. Any other colours in the fur coat I bought last time? It comes in four more colours. I'll take one of each. Hmm, something to match Mr. Ma's jacket every time Just a moment. Sure. How much? Five thousand two hundred. So expensive. It's worth every penny. You sure can pick. It's a gift from you, I must pick what I truly like. Helen, Anna. Tina, what a surprise! I'm bored, that's why I come shopping. If you're bored, get pregnant. That's right. Is it pretty? Yes. Let me try them on. I'm a size 7, do you have that size? This is size 6 and a half, try it on. It might fit. Anna's gift. Why? It's her birthday? No, she introduced me a boyfriend, I'm giving her a gift. Who? It's that fat guy. I'm going to Europe with him tomorrow. Look at him. I've noticed him couldn't stop staring at you since you walked this way. Can't be. Find someone who loves you and marry him. That's easy to say, but difficult when it comes to reality. Is this ok? I'll take it, pack it up. Right away. Hey, it's been a while. Why do you look so terrible? An imbalance of the yin and the yang? She's married, How's that possible? Your husband can't get it up? Come on, it's just lack of sleep because of socializing How have you been? Walking around like a headless chicken. What do you think? Looks great. 4,420 dollars Didn't you say $5,200? Mrs. Ma is our VIP, she has a 15% discount. Anna, you've saved eight hundred dollars. Pay UP- I don't have so much cash. Tell the fat guy to pay. Ok. Hey, Anna's asked you to settle the bill. Who's that? She's pretty. Feasting eyes on next dish before finishing the first can you handle it? Pay UP! I'll get back my money's worth. You tell Anna in Europe. Eighteen thousand seven hundred in total. Mrs. Ma. One each. Thanks... The fat guy is busy tonight, why not join us for a fun night out? Sure. Oh, I can't. My husband is hosting a dinner tonight. Dam n. You don't care about us anymore. That's right. Sorry, when Anna returns from Europe, we'll get together again. Really? Thanks, Mrs. Ma. Rosa, is it? So full of herself Did you say that? Stella did. Boss Ho can't destroy me, just like you; you seem to do pretty well, too. It doesn't matter if I can't be a model, look at me, I'm better off now. Women are strong. Are you tired? Let me give you a massage. You have great skin, it feels good. You do this quite well, do you massage others or get a massage? I like both. I own this place, do come often. What was that? Relax. You can't always have good days. When you've grown old, forget about me serving you then. You knew that I've guests tonight, why are you home so late? I'm sorry, I fell asleep in the sauna. Forget it, go get changed! Simon, come here. I've good news. What news? We had a meeting, Mr. Jones mentioned about you joining the Legco. Thanks. Simon, the Governor knows that you're married. But don't worry, tomorrow we'll sign the documents. That shouldn't be any problem, you can trust me. You'll get your confirmation by the end of next month. Congratulations! Thanks for your support. We've all wanted you to join. Where's Mr. Ma? He's going out. Mrs. Ma, what time do you want to eat? I don't want to eat. So? Not asleep yet? Can't sleep, I'm waiting for you. It's okay You know it's the last thing on my mind, go to bed. Lady My license was revoked for speeding in another country, but still it wasn't as reckless as you. If you'd like a race, pick a date, and I need a different car. Sorry, I'm not interested to race you. There's a telegram from the HQ in Singapore. The boss has ordered to hold the Ma Computers stocks from going public. Ignore him, I'm in charge here. I could do whatever I wish. Mr. Ma, what's bothering you lately? Is it because of her? Why don't you let her run a small business? Would it work? Better than nothing to do. Has the fat guy contacted you since you' re back? I'm glad that he hasn't. You don't get along with him? Of course not. How come? The first night in Europe, he brought two black guys in the hotel. I thought... oh no! It turned out that he was banging the black guys. He's gay? I had no idea. It's sick, don't bring it up again. Then why did he ask me to look for you? He's bisexual. Are you here to play? Coming... You play with her first, she's no match for me. Alright. Tina. Why do you look upset every time I see you? Is that so? She gets materialistic fulfillment, but not emotional; of course she isn't happy. Why don't you do some business? My husband suggested the same thing. But I'm not sure what. Modeling agency. But one needs production support for that. If you have money, that shouldn't be a problem. I've a friend who's a stage director, he just came back from France. You mean Sam? Yes. Great, introduce them. Sure. Hey Sam. I'd like you to meet my friend. Sam, this is Tina. It's you! So you know each other. If that's the case, we wouldn't have argued. Sam, Tina needs your help on something. Sure. Remember to attend the class next Monday. Sure, bye. Is Helen here? Regarding what? Mr. Ho introduced me to be a receptionist here. It's me, you're Nancy? Yes. He spoke to me yesterday, fill in the application form first. I'll tell them to re-do these, don't worry. I almost crashed into you the other night. Sorry. You still remember? No entertaining tonight? I turned them down, I wanted to eat with you. A toast to your business Let's hope your company will grow bigger than mine. Thanks... for someone who didn't show up at the opening I'm making it up to you. Tina What is it? Nothing. Why are you crying? Didn't expect you being so nice to me. Really? Maybe now I've just realised that I've a great family, a good wife. I met with the Governor yesterday and he talked to me about the councilor, there will be an announcement soon. No wonder you're so happy. I want you to be happy too. Hello. Mr. Ma, I'm Zhichao. What is it? The tender for Wharf Holdings' land closes tomorrow. You still haven't decided on the price. What do you think, Mr. Ma? Mr. Ma, hello? Who is it? Mr. Ho is waiting for you. It's urgent. It will take a while. Will you give me a massage? It's so one way, you don't know how to enjoy. You know? It's better to give a massage than getting one. In that case, I ought to massage you. Try. Just think why men are so keen on night club hostesses, and you'll understand. Oh please! Which part of you hasn't been touched by a man? My heart. No man has ever touched my heart. Don't you have a boyfriend? Yes, they left on the space shuttle, all rubbish. What kind of a man do you prefer? Mr. Zhao, he really knows how to enjoy women. How did you know? You hooked up with him? No, l just want to be like him. Who's this? Hold on. Tina, your call. Hello, Zhichao. Business so soon? Do it well. That boss is a friend of mine. You must pay special attention, that's all. There's no need to let her know I'm the boss, I don't want her to rely on me. Sure. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, B, 7, 8... another leg... Tina, this is a close replica of the Indian Kohinoor. We need to return it after the show. It's pretty, look. Very pretty. You're so sweaty. You've had a tough day, let's go out for a dance. Thanks. You've found a good helper. Thanks. From now on, no more business. Just enjoy the evening. Look at her. Konbanwa Come on. Where's the phone? Over there. Hello Your husband hasn't left you, is it? Or else Why'd you be playing Madame Butterfly here! I don't want to talk about him, I'm so bored. All he does is entertain others, he ignores me at night. It doesn't make any difference if I'm married or not. What? He ignores you at night? You can sue him for ill treatment Has he ill-treated you? I don't know. Can't be. If it's like that, how can he be a councilor? True. I know you won't believe me, but he really ignores me. I must have a good time tonight. Fine! We'll have fun. Guess who loses, guess who loses... Drink up... Look at you! You don't look like a celebrity wife. You are worse than night club hostesses. Aren't you fond of them? I was just trying to learn from them. Shut up. You had a good time with the two women earlier? How come you're home so early? You can't get it up again? What are you talking about? I just want to know what's your sex drive like? Strong, average or low. I get it... You've strong sex drive when it comes to the bar chicks but low sex drive when facing your wife. Why aren't you looking at me? Am I not pretty? Don't I have a good figure? Have a good look! Feel it! Why don't you dare? Can't believe I am not better than those women! Cheap whore! Yes, I'm cheap. Wouldn't have married you otherwise. You're worse. You wouldn't marry me if you're not cheap. You hit me? You whore! I know what you need, come on. Let go! Just act like her! Come on! Take a closer look. Why aren't you paying attention? Is this what you like to watch? Watch away! Why aren't you watching? Go! Go! Go! Tom my! I'll give you another thousand, Ben. Stay calm. You can't raise the stakes now. Says who? Bravo! Tommy seems to be doing better than Ben. I don't think so, I think Ben will win. Mrs. Tan, where did you take him last night? Shut up! You brat! Where did you take him? Way to go, Tommy! Way to go, Tommy! Tom my, you're great. Well done! It's all yours. Okay. I'm impressed, Tommy. Keep me company tonight. I'm tired. What's the big deal? I'll get Ben to go with me. I'll take you out, Tommy. I've earned enough. Big deal. He's a gigolo. I'll introduce you if you're interested. Tell him to join me for a drink. Sure. You could take that attitude? I have to if I don't want to remain poor. It's one way or the other. You would do anything for money? I wouldn't do a thing if you don't pay enough. It's noisy here. I know a quiet place, would you like to join me? You need these? Who's doing the beating? Doesn't matter, but the charges are different. I need to pay you to beat me up? It's all about the technique. I won't charge you if you beat me. Let me give you a massage. I've had many clients, but you've the best skin of all. Do you go to the bars often? How come I haven't seen you before? You talk too much. You're the best client I've had so far. Yours. Thanks, Mrs. Ma. Remember, I'm not Mrs. Ma. Miss X. I hope to serve you again. Call me anytime. You won't see me again. Be more sexy. Sit on it, the side. Stand together, face me, good. Hands on waist. Bend. No, not like that. Hand, here. Put your feet closer. You're too fat to be a model. She said I could. I said you could learn, didn't say you could work as one. Then what's the point for me? At least you could learn something. I quit, I want a refund. There's no refund after you've taken the course. I don't care. Refund! Don't run! Give my money back. What's going on? I can't work on someone so awful. I'll do it. Zhichao, you're still here. Yes. Where's Simon? In the study. Don't you need to go to the nightclub with Mr. Jones, why are you still here? Leaving right now. Tina. Not busy today? Since the three top models have left, I've lots of free time. Come on. There are so many fashion shows in Hong Kong, we can't take all the jobs. Right. I've taken on a big show, and would like you to help me with it. What about me? Certainly. How do you want me to help? You know that there are only a handful of good modeling agencies in Hong Kong. I want to borrow your girls for the show, and I'll give you a commission afterwards. No problem. It's time! Get your make up on! To our partnership. Anna, go and teach them how to put on make up. Sure. Helen Stella has a show and would like to hire our models, arrange it. Just contact me. The boss is treating us to dinner tonight, I'd like to bring a few models along, to let him have faith in the show, alright? Sorry. We're a modeling agency, not a brothel. We're in the same line of work. You've knocked on the wrong door. If you want some girls to entertain your boss, you can call up the escorts service. So? Got turned down? Boss Ho. Why didn't you let me know if I can make some money? You have connections? Of course. I'm in charge of Tina's models. Hop in. Sure. Stella, look at these. What are you doing? Taking pictures of you. Haven't you taken enough? No. You look different in different settings. I want to capture your charisma. You surely know how to please a woman. I meant it. I liked you from the first time I saw you, I didn't even know your name. I'm working with you on this show just because I want to be near you. Don't be silly, I've a husband. I don't care. I love you just the same. Or you'd prefer me to say "I love you"? You're crazy! Stop kidding around! I'm serious! It can't be, I've a good family, a husband who loves me, it's impossible. If he loves you so much, why doesn't he spend the holidays with you? If you're so happy, what are you doing here in the middle of the night? Stop kidding yourself. You've a husband, money and status, but he doesn't love you. You' re talking crap. I'm not. You have nothing, except me. Nothing can stop me from loving you. What are you doing? Why are you here? Why can't I come in? You're not allowed in without my permission hereafter. Come on, I'm your wife. I know. I need you to play the good wife in public. What do you take me for? A vase? Some antique? I'm a person! You can ask for a divorce if you don't need me. I've made it clear from the start you can have anything you want, except sex life. But you can't divorce me. I'll look for other men if I can't get a divorce. I'm going to Singapore for a meeting, I won't be back until a week later. You have plenty of chance to look for guys. But I warn you; I'm someone with status. I won't let you get away if you're in some kind of scandal. Who's this? Who's this? Why leave since you're here? Why are you here at this hour? Waiting for you; I knew you'd be back. I don't like men who lie. You want the truth? I jerk off ogling at your photographs. You're sick. Let go of me! What are you doing? Stop! No. Don't! Let go! Don't! Are you tired? Let me give you a massage. No, thanks. I'm busy today. Take care, bye. Hi. You must be tired, let me give you a massage. No, I'm busy today. You enjoy yourself. No! No! Why are you avoiding me? Why won't you look at me? You think you're that special? Morning... ls Tina around? Thanks. Thanks. Finished so soon? It's better when I'm inspired. The fashion designs are all ready, go pick the material You can do it, I need to pick some music. There's a rehearsal later. Let's have dinner. Sure. Bye. Nancy, were you looking for me? Oh, you were right. If Mr. Ma finds out, I wonder what will happen. Stop it. I told them to do it. What do you want? Nothing, just want a word with you. Go on. My boss bought a wife; If you so much like to spend time with her, my boss could buy you too. Tell your boss that, if he tries to buy me, he'd be in trouble. Tell him to keep the money for his coffin. I want to leave town after the ShOW'S over. Why? It doesn't suit me here. Why not? The city is full of energy. Anyway, the population here isn't much. People come and go in the hustle & bustle oi central Tsim Sha Tsui and Mung Kok. They are all monsters. To me, they are all money-printing machines. Some make coins, some print notes. But the funny thing is, they don't know what they're doing. All I want is for everything to stay the same always. Interesting. It's more like pathetic. People here don't have a life. Lifeless folks. They thought they know how to enjoy, but they haven't enjoyed life. Tina, come with me. We're going to have a good life. You think Mrs. Ma and Mr. Li can have a good life? You can divorce him. He married me so that he could show the world that he is a family man. He can't be a councilor if he's divorced, he'd rather die. Think it over. After the show, you will board the flight with me. Qiang, who's she? The new maid. Where's Maria? She got fired by Mr. Ma. Why? She found an earring in the study, Mr. Ma said she moved his stuff without permission. Where's Mr. Ma? He's playing golf, isn't back yet. I told you to mind your own business. Why are you so stupid? Do you feel better now that you've found out? You're not human! I won't stay with you anymore. You want to leave me? Maybe on the day you die. I know you want to torture me till that day. You want to feel better? Let me tell you Today onwards just pretend you don't know anything; don't interfere with my life. Then you're still Mrs. Ma, of the upper crust. I'd rather be a hooker. You don't deserve to be a hooker. You think I don't know your secret? I am just too smart to lay it out. Sam. Tina, what is it? Tell me. I'll leave with you after the show. I knew it. Hurry! It's time for the rehearsal. Helen, these are the copies, distribute them. Sure. Don't worry. You'll know in the rehearsal. Hurry. Why isn't Sam here yet? He said he'd be back by ten. But he's still not here. Call him. Helen, play the music. Let them practise. Sure. The line is constantly engaged. Is the phone out of order? Remember, there are four columns around here. Strike a pose here. Come on. Anna, you come out from here. OK, turn, lower the arm. Helen, you take care of things here. I'll look for Sam. Alright. Hello? Speaking. Great. I'll transfer the money to you right away. Remember, we will never meet again. Sure, good luck. Sam... What happened, Sam? Who did this? Sam... Mrs. Ma, what are you doing here? One of my staff died. What post was he at? Mrs. Ma, what's his name? Is it a murder? That I'm not sure. But something happened at home. If you want to report, follow me. I've a very interesting tape to show you. So? Go with her. Come on. Mrs. Ma told us to come in. Let them in. Mrs. Ma... What's the tape about? Call over more reporters here. I'll have a press conference in the study. Mr. Ma and Mr. Ho in the room, nobody else in. The main characters of the scandal are both here. You can take more pictures later. Follow me. Come on. So it's you! Stop! Get out! This is what a celebrity's true self is. No pictures! Get out! Get out! No pictures! I'll call the police if you don't leave. Get out! This sure is big news. Never mind her. Let's hurry back in time for the news typeset.
