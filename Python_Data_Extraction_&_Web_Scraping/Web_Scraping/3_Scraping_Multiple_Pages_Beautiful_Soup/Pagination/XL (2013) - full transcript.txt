This gimp has to go! Are you OK? His clothes. You wake up. You exist but not really. You wake up, barely. You are afraid to feel. That's how all days begin. And all days are but one day. Eir¡kur, relax. Are you OK? - Are YOU OK? Hi. Well, my brother in arms. How are you? I'm fine, just very fine. Yes, thanks for your patience and sorry for keeping you. Yes, is something wrong? No, I would not put it that way. Have a chocolate. No thanks. It's from The Belgian Ambassador. Go ahead. Yes. Thanks. Perverts. What? The Belgians. Perverts. Ok, more so then others? Yes. Brussels man. All this European Union bullshit. Political perverts. All sharing the same bed and... oopsie daisy. ™ssi, you don't have to stress the EU... No, I know but can I depend on you Leifur, in this war? ™ssi, we have known each other since we were kids. Hell, look at this. And I'm supposed to be 15 years older than you. No, we were not kids at the same time. Are you drunk? What? No. No no, I am just trying to be polite, give you a chance. That's why I'll ask you again, Leifur: Are you drunk? I... I have hardly had a drop, that is to say, I don't feel drunk. It's Tuesday Leifur. Modern time's a bitch, I know, but this just won't fly. Today, there is a lot of pressure. And this pressure demands that you go into rehab. Rehab? ™ssi! We have booked an appointment for you in "Hope". "Hope"? The National Rehab Centre? Yes. You have to show humility and remorse. ™ssi. You will show up for the appointment and they will book you into rehab. And you have to get rid of your dive. My jive? Your DIVE. The Bar, Leifur. We all falter at some point. Why do all alcoholics think that everyone else is too? I'm not saying that you are an alcoholic, It's your life that says so. At least after Sj”fn kicked you out. ™ssi, what about you and all your bullshit? Didn't you go into luxury rehab in Sweden? You didn't have to do your shit time locally. It wasn't me who was stinking drunk in some bar downtown and got into a fistfight which made it to the papers and YouTube with shots from two angles. ™ssi, this was, it wasn't a bar, it was an art exhibition, part of an arts performance. That's what I have been trying to convince the media of. It doesn't matter what it was. Leifur. Ehh, Leifur Sigurdsson. SIGURDARSON. I'm sorry, if you want to say it correctly. You have to excuse me, just had a difficult meeting. Might I ask you mam to contact the office of the Parliament and then send me an e-mail with your concern. This is private. Yes, well, I am just heading for another important meeting. It's personal. I am ’sa's mother. I have to speak to you. Are you ’sa's mother? Let's grab a bite, come with me. This is very sad news. ’sa never said anything to me about this. So you are going to stop seeing her? No. I am not going to do that. I can't really say that me and ’sa have been together much. She is a grown woman. A grown woman? Yes and as such she has a right to make her own decisions. She is a free person in a free country. I can't restrain her freedom, I'll not be party to that game. Wait, didn't you hear what I was saying? Yes Sigrun, I heard you quite well, everyone has their own demons to deal with. A nunnery, Sigrun. Since you were so worried about her, then you shouldn't have sent her to the capital and not to that art school and that fucking circus show. Nunnery! Sigrun. Was she adopted? You're a little baby with a big cock. Thanks. Keli, Cheers! Are you drunk? (From the TV) Bitches. (From the TV) Hey bitch. (From the TV) Bitch. (From the TV) Bitch. (From the TV) Bitch. Hey, bitches. Where is my phone? I don't know. (From the TV) PUSSY! Bitch! What is this? You know what it is. Is it that asshole with the dildo? (From the TV) Bitch. Yo, Bitch. Bitch. (Phone) Are you good? I am sexy. How are you? When did you leave? After I went down on your honeypussy. She really liked it. - Really? I want more. Don't penetrate her today. Are you fucking with me? No! Happy Easter! Happy Easter. Are you ready for tonight? Hello? Anyone home? Yeah? Ok, why? Hey doggie. Take your head out of her bleached anus for one second and concentrate. Operation "Prime Minister". - Yeah, right. Throwing a party? Yeah, but more like official business, foreign dignitaries. I'm sorry, forgot something. My mothers port. Good to have one drinkie after the cake. Thanks, mom. This doesn't make any sense. I have never heard such wonderful nonsense. Don't get so terribly emotional, mom. Cheers. I always saw you as a Minister. Or even... You would definitely be as good as ™rn. Even better. You have such a great eye for details and we know that the devil lies in the details. That's not out of the question. I know darling, I just wanted to hear you say it. But this is quite a trick he has pulled Leifur. It is very smart. The old man fears you. Yes, maybe. That is probably what's happening here. This is a message that you need to pull yourself together but that is easily within you grasp. Would you like some more darling? No, I have to get going. Ok son, you do what you have to do. I'll place a call to my friend and offer her an interview with you. No please don't. But there's one who has a talk show, I could talk to her. Lovely girl. I know her mother so well, I could talk to her. Mum, not yet. Leifur, dear, people will find out whether you like it or not. And I would like to see this get respectable treatment. You can turn this to your advantage. See, you choose to support the local rehab centre but not to do as all the others who have fallen before you who went abroad like exiles to do their rehab there. You haven't done anything wrong. You have always wanted to do the right thing. Always. Mother. I am not going into fucking rehab. Leave! Bullseye! Long time no "farewell to booze" party. Far too long. This isn't a farewell anything. I will be right back you know. Yeah but the last party before rehab fucking devils mass, man. Leifur, you were going to lend me some money. Was I going to lend you money? Give me, five hundred. Five hundred?! Or a million. Yeah, and why was I going to give you all that money? Because we are... Beacause we are what? Need a word? A king and his princess. Sj”fn! What now? Don't let me interrupt, let's go inside. Ohhh, please not this again. Yes, Sj”fn, I am her father. Leifur come back when you have gotten some help. Can't you help me? Sj”fn I love you, always more and more and we are married. Sign the papers, let your slutty lawyer have them. You've had three months. Sj”fn, I'm going into rehab. When? Just as soon as you are willing to give us another try. I think you have had enough tries. I know that I have been drinking too much lately. Sj”fn. Go away. Sj”fn. Sj”fn. Leave. Stop it! I need to get you into that chair. The Prime Minister's. Lie still. Sj”fn. What's up? This is not an option anymore. You have to go. You have to go. Stay or go peanut? Make up your mind. Leifur. There, there Sj”fn. Don't touch me. Don't touch... I know that I have been gone for a bit. Three days. Don't count the days, peanut. Never count the days. You are such a loser. Never count because then you forget all the good stuff. I want you to go. Please go. I hate you. I hate you. Sj”fn. Let me go, let me go! Sj”fn, Sj”fn. Stop it! Anna, love. Your mother wants me to leave. Anna. Thanks for the t-shirt, it's brilliant. I love it. Your mother wants me to go. Are you guys just going to ruin Christmas? You're leaving. Sj”fn, Sj”fn. Sj”fn! What's new with you and ’sa? Are you jealous? Yes. But not of her. I wouldn't mind being you while you undress her. She probably wouldn't mind either. Are you together every day? Do you think I'm being selfish? Yes, of course you are. But I don't mind because I get enough action myself. You didn't want to be with me. I can't be alone, you know that. Come on Leifur, You know what I'm like. Krist¡na. Can we... Maybe five minutes in the bathroom? Excuse me. Did she go to the bathroom? No, she just left. Ok?! Are you paying the bill? No, just put it on the tab. Arni! Great to see you. Hi. Losers. Yes, hello? Hi. Hi darling. Just called to remind you about tonight. Why? Don't I always remember? No. Ok. I'll remember tonight. Can I bring a friend? She also my girlfriend? I don't think so, her name is Krist¡na, she's a lawyer Sure, whatever. Bring her along. Anna dear... There is no pornography in this, is there? What? You know tonight? You know like last time there was a lot of porn. Come on, Dad. Kristina, please, can't we just fuck like normal people? What do you want? I want you. Me? Yes. Turn around. Not to hard, not to hard please. You ugly, dirty boy. Would you like some more? Put the mask on. Turn around. Kristina, this isn't fun. Bark! More! Where is the doggies tongue? Don't you touch me. Do you want me to be good to doggy? Stop it! What? I am in charge. I didn't do anything. You're the boss. I am not in the mood anymore. What? I am not in the mood! No! I only need maybe ten or twenty seconds. Let me just finish. Ok, but I don't want to see you. Ok, I'm just going to. Ohh yes. I can't touch you? No. I have to be able to touch you to cum. Forget it. This is too much hassle. Excited? Stressed out. Really, why? Just worried that someone is trying to drag my little girl into something perverted. Isn't she just like her old man? How could we have met? You said you worshipped me and I told you what I thought of older men. Ahh, there comes your "uncle". My uncle?! Is he abusing his mother? Well... Ohhh, how typical. What? Ahh you know, he has a teddy bear... Cute bear, reminds me of you. Jesus and Peter. Oh god, how typical. It's art. Yeah, OK. Exactly. Of course, now for the dildo. All this porn shit. Can't these so called artists think of anything new? You have no idea of what you are speaking about so shut up. Well, there is she is. Yes there she is. She is really cute. Not at all like her old man. What is uncle doing? What is uncle doing? Dad! Pervert! What's wrong with you? Do you get into fights often? Never. Final answer. So what happened... It wasn't a fight. It was art. Art? Ok, I am not a critic or the police for that matter. Do you often blackout? Are you joking? No, not at all. Ok, well once that I can think of, a long time ago. I was competing against this really big guy, he had eaten twelve hot dogs and I knew I wouldn't be able to beat him. Not BACKING out, Blacking out. That is a lot more serious. Know the term? Yes. Leifur? No. Final answer. Final answer. How many drinks per week? I often have to go to cocktail parties for work, I drink in all of them. I can send you last year's schedule. Is there alcoholism in your family? Not that I know of, but I guess so, we Icelanders are a nation of drinkers. Does your mother drink? She sips her port. Great... Sorry? She likes her drink then? Look, Leifur, you have agreed to go into rehab, to go into detox. I just get the feeling that you don't really want to. But the circumstances are odd, I realize. It's not everyday we have the Prime Minister calling us but I think the whole thing stinks. Because we have waiting lists full of people, people that want to be here, and long to get well. Grateful people and then you show up and just march in here when you have obviously not reached the bottom and that my friend, Leifur. That's the final answer. Stinks, eh? Listen to me you little shit. Are you skipping school? How much did he promise you to put me on the VIP list and keep quiet? Twenty five? Fifty? Let me guess. One hundred million. Just be grateful. In about a month you can start to treat all these great people in which you think so highly of. All those goddamn drunkards who can't hold their... You know Haraldur, you are right about one thing. I haven't reached the bottom yet, because I am heading straight for the top. Hi. Hi. Listen up, the bastard is humiliating me and I don't like it. I am going into a meeting. Can I be next? Business? Maybe a little pleasure too. No, I'll just see you tonight. Hey, come to the window, I want to see you. Are you outside? Yes. I'll be a little late tonight. That's ok, the night is young. See you. See you tonight. Stop it! Hi. Maestro. Danny boy. I'm getting ridiculously good at this. Oh, Stasia. Leif. Danni, can you spare some? Sure, not a problem. Thanks for the lesson. ’sa, don't I get a kiss? Sure, come here. Wow. Thanks for the drink. Listen up! On the house. Hrafnkell, are you a cheater? I just get it elsewhere sometimes, like you. Then it feels so good to return. Yeah, that's what we all say. Let me see your eyes. It's of no use. Keli! Come on. No! Wait a minute, wait. Let me see. Something else, eh? Cheers. Cheers! Left foot on red, right hand on red. Left foot on green, oh Lord. Ok, wait. You have to return to the same place, you know? I know, I.. Good luck with that. My leg's cramping. Who won? I won. Oh really? I won. No, I won. I won because I am the King of the Universe. You know I won. Admit that I won. Hey, motherfucker you didn't win. I did so. Hey. Hey. I won. I won. Get off me! Fucking bitch. ’sa? Yes. I met your mother. She told me you had been in trouble. Bullshit. What did she tell you? She talked about a shrink and stuff. Ok, so she told you how she freaked out? No, she didn't say that... Me and my friend found some DVD's at her dad's place. We were nine years old. I remember we didn't really understand... what was going on... and the kids we showed it to didn't understand either but it wasn't much fun just watching. So we added to the gang this boy in a wheelchair. I remember how thrilled his parents were. We always picked him up after school. Turned out he was the biggest pervert of us all. Good evening! Mushrooms. Salty lamb. Ok I'll have four of these. Veal schnitzel! And filet of beef as well. And we're also going to make... Beef Wellington. It's best I do this myself. Beef Wellington. I need 3 kilos of tenderloin. Maybe 8 rib-eye. Veal, two loads of meat and six of these. What about this one? - Are you joking? He wants to kiss me. Pig! We need a pig! Leifur? Leifur what's wrong? She won't let me see her. Poor baby, don't cry. Please don't cry. What am I going to do if you're crying? You're my big, strong guy. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Let's just go abroad. What you say, should we go abroad? Where did you want to go? Berlin? Should we go to Berlin? No, it's too cold in Berlin. Baby, where do you want to go? I want to go to Singapore. Remember, I take care of you and you take care of me. Is this enough? - Yes. Cheers. Do you need something else? - This is good. And the olive oil whispers maybe... These are the smallest brussels sprouts I've ever seen. Can't be bothered cutting them. Hi. Cool shades. Antonius gave us an Easter egg. Wow, grand. I believe he loves you. You punched him so hard, he's become famous in Japan. We've been booked for the festival in Tokyo. Wow, you don't say. Yes. Next summer will be awesome. But, any luck with the money? Look in my jacket. Thanks. Good to see you, welcome. Congratulations on the engagement. Thanks. Let me see the ring. Nice, huh? I'm not hungry at all. How does it look? Who's coming? Various people. Where's ’sa? You know them all. Good, good. You're never hungry. Hrafnkell? Where's ’sa? She just went out, she'll be back in a bit. But I'm not hungry You have to eat once in a while. Don't you want to last into the evening? I ate today. Lunch? Yes, and you told me not to eat too much. Yeah, so you could eat something tonight. Actually, do you have strawberries and champagne? Yes, is that what you want? Oh, yes. A toast for the master... How did it go today? It was alright. But the studio in London is so much better. I'm not so sure I want to record this album if I have to do it here. At least... I would make a different sort of record, you know. Something with more lyrics and less... of all the rest. It needs to be unbelievably perfect these days. I knew it the second I saw the microphone... it would be rather pointless singing into it. Unless I was singing about yoghurt or something. This won't do. No. Eir¡kur, this won't do. What? You need to take Bj”rk to London so she doesn't have to sing about some dairy products. What are you doing? I thought she looked hungry. She travelled all alone from China. Shh baby, don't cry, just drink. This doll wasn't for you. I wouldn't give a doll to a doll. Relax, I'll put her back in a minute. How does it feel to be sucked? Wouldn't you know that better than me? I'll tell you how it feels to swallow. Don't kill the moment. What kind of mother are you going to be? Or old woman? You don't need to worry about that, old man. She looks just like you. Really? Look at her lips. No, those are your lips. ’sa! We need clearly defined roles. Do you agree? Do you agree? Yes. Yes, right? Look, there are certain rules, you understand? There are certain rules, and you are young. You are young but you're just young enough. You're not too young, you see? You're not too young. Now we are even. Sj”fn. Do you feel it? You've got the youth and I've got all the rest. I've got the power and I'm willing to share it with you... but then we have to be in sync. Understand? We have to be in sync. For that we need clearly defined roles. Do you understand that? I'm a man and you're a woman, a goddess and I worship you. Do you feel it? Do you feel how much I worship you? Feel how I worship you. Good one! So did you know that my friend, Hrafnkell, is writing a novel? Really, a thriller? No, it isn't a thriller. It's about ethics or civilization or the like. I'm so deeply grateful for this food, that I have no desire to express myself about this matter. Yeah, that's fine. You'll just do that later on, when you've gotten in gear. Darling, what are we feasting on? Cunt Wellington. Exactly, it's a gender corrected Wellington. It's excellent. I put parma ham and garlic into the mushroom mash and then I roll up the whole thing. I wrap it in butter dough... then we've got brussel sprouts, the bacon, pine nuts, onion... Can the girls play that... sing thing? You know, I accidentally broke the disc the other day. Leifur? I bought a new one. What? Who wants to allow the girls to play sing sing? Well, no. I'm the King and the King has decided that we will not play sing sing. But please try again later tonight. Sweetie. I'm just so positive because of this food. I've decided that I will, someday, open a country kitchen, you know, the kind of place with honest food. With the all the trans fats. I'm going to show up every evening. That will happen when we have sorted our matters. What, is there something new? No, no. Are you keeping something from me, you idiot? You two need to relax, just stay calm, nothing's changed and nothing is going to change. I'm starting to worry about you two. Calm down! The Jester was missing. He's a fucking gimp. Girls! Get him out of here. Come get Hrafnkell and then you can play sing sing. What's he doing here? Finally someone who is interesting. Interesting? I wish I was so tiny I could live somewhere inside you. What about you? I like being able to visit inside you. But I was thinking, what if you came with me to Tokyo? You wouldn't need to come to the show or anything. It's not so far from Singapore is it? No. And, we could visit Kobu. Kobe. And... have some tea. (Go: Operation Prime Minister) Can I take the Easter egg? Our Easter egg? Yes. Sure. ’sa, was Anna at the rehearsal? Yes. Does she know about us? Leifur, yes. You're a stupid little cow, do you know that? Where the hell have you been? You're one hour too late! Was it a 5 minute fuck? - Idiot. Be ready. - OK. Wait a minute, what's going on here? Isn't this ™rn Arnarson, Prime Minister? Leifur. You think I don't recognize you, you idiot? This is not your wife Maria, is it? No, it's Krist¡na Loyola, celebrity lawyer. Turn off the fucking phone! My Mar¡a was diagnosed with cancer... about a month ago, and has been in intensive treatment since. The day we got the diagnosis, she told me that I shouldn't feel bad about seeking a sexual outlet elsewhere. But the fact is I have felt bad about it. If you let the media know about this then Mar¡a and I will be forced to give an intimite interview where we will have to talk about everything, the illness, that we wanted to wrestle with in peace, we will talk about marriage and love, our mature love that... what are you doing? I'm just, I'm just calling Mar¡a. Wishing her well, I care so much about her. Hi. Leifur? Leifur, I can see it's you. Leifur. Leifur, when are we going to meet, just me and you? You know, I had a dream about you. What are you doing with that cake on the bed? It's the dessert. You're supposed to have girls, viagra, blow jobs, the whole deal. Not this cake and fruits in the bed. I think more clearly while I eat. What do you mean thinking? We're drunk, feeling good, the girls are outside. I am thinking about how we're going to get out of this rehab bullshit. I'm thinking about how I'm going to rally the people, calm everyone down, set things up, go to the National Convention, cut off ™rn's balls. Spread his insides all over the hall like it was candy while I give the winning speech. I'm thinking Eir¡kur. And I'm thinking fucking clearly as well. That's my man. You want to say hello to my little friends? Sj”fn is here. Here? She doesn't want to come up. Is the phone lost? No, it's better like this. Is it? You look so good. Are you having a party? Dinner party. Drinking party. Is Anna up there? Anna? Yes, Anna, our daughter, you might remember her. Yes, I know who she is. But she's not here, why would she be? She's lost. Anna? Yes, Anna is lost. No, she's not lost. Just wait, she will call. Relax, there's nothing wrong. Are you really going to contest me on our daughter being missing? Sj”fn, I have a dinner party. I can't just go. I'll call her, I'll find her. She's not lost, don't worry about this. Ok, thanks. Her name is Anna Leifsd¢ttir. Yes. You have two hours. No bullshit. Clear. Are we going to sit here and cry like bitches? Or are we going out there and fuck those bitches? We're going out there to fuck those bitches. Here is cake. Did the party go to heaven without us? Eir¡kur, relax. I don't want my girl riding a donkey. Eir¡kur, Eir¡kur. This filth should never be naked. Relax. Are you OK, Hrafnkell? What did you give him? Weed... -And... Mushrooms. Let's get through this cake. Eir¡kur, relax. This gimp was never supposed to be here! Where are his clothes? Those old idiots. I fucking hate those old, burned-out losers. Relax, Eir¡kur. Will he be all right? Are you alright? Yes. Did you take mushrooms? Yes. Mom and dad are over for dinner and we're having coffee so. I brought this for our little one. For Laufey? Yes. I know it's too big. But I know that her mother is always willing to help out. I was just thinking maybe I could... maybe read for her. Come with me. I'm going to show you something. Let's just sort this out once and for all. No Laufey here. Come. No Laufey. Now there's only the living room left and that's where the guests are. But.. There is no little Laufey there either. Sj”fn, Sj”fn, I... Come and see, it'll do you good darling. Thank the lord. A toast to you. Evening. Hi. No. This is just... nonsense. Thanks. Well. Good to see you all. What's going on? That guy. My phone, ™rn. Leifur. My brother in arms. We need to do something, together. Do something about this. I have a plan. I will... lead you into rehab and out again. From there we will go together, no bullshit, hand in hand, you and me to the National Convention this fall. Leifur. How does that sound? You and I. The new candidate for the vice-chair, the new future leader. Reborn and whitewashed. You're in the shit. Let me guide you, all the way. Will you let me do that? Epictetus was a master of morals. An ethicist. He wanted people to spend their lives in quietness, not always do what they wanted to do, but resist temptation. Above all, resist temptation. And then you will say: but flesh is dust that can eat and drink and fuck for a while and then it's over. Why not risk it? Everything's going to be alright. Shots for everyone. Cheers! Danni. You'll leave her alone. Stop bugging Eir¡kur. You'll leave her alone. I need to go. Are you guys leaving? You know I have to but I will see you later. See you later cutie. See you, thanks for the help. What news are there from Parliament? What? I just asked, what news are there from Parliament? The Psalms? Yes, straight out of the master's mouth. Mr. P‚tursson was a good priest and poet but the Psalms overshadowed the real masterpieces, the drinking songs. Can I offer the gentleman some refreshment? No, if it's all the same. Can I offer the gentleman refreshment? OK. You. You. Always working. Both of us. What am I doing here? Yes, what are you doing here? This was a real question. What am I doing here? Are you perhaps coming to rehearsal? Drink? I don't drink alcohol. Not even do warm you up? Not even to perfect a lobster soup. Maybe you came here to apologize? It's actually I who... Do you think I should apologize to you? How did you like that? It's actually not good to start like that, at the top, this is XO. Anna! Come here! Call your mother! Your mother is out of her mind with worries. Call her! Call her before I kill this fucking boyfriend idiot. Fuck off you pussydoughnut! Are you calling her? Yes. Tell her I said hi. Do you need backup? No, no. I'm done here. Complete victory. Dad. I'll be back in a minute. Go away you fucker. Do you really think this is OK? What? I live here. And he is not my boyfriend. Not everyone is like you. Anna dear, what are you talking about? Who is like me? Not everybody forgets their daughter's birthday like you. When did I ever forget a birthday? Do you need money or anything? No thanks, just leave. Come with us. Is there a party? Come on. Fuck him. No. Come on, girl. Fuck him. Ah, yes. Shut up. Eirikur. Are you OK? Laufey. Welcome. Nice to see you. Welcome. Anna, dear. My dear, sweet love. See what daddy has for you. Your drawing is so beautiful. You need to sign it. Laufey Anna. Dear friends - I was able to write down a few words. Although one can never be completely prepared for such... I apologize, sorry - unable to find the speech. But I don't need that piece of paper. I've been preparing for this moment for a long time. Dear... my dear I am ready party representatives Changes were needed. Just call me when this is over. You won't take long, will you? Just a quicky, right? Everything will be fine. Come home. Be a man, boy. Come home. Then I'll wash your back. That's the way it is. Come home. Clearly defined roles. You are a man. I'm a woman. I'm a Goddess. And I worship you. Do you feel it? You make me this way, This is my body and you make me this way. Can you feel it? Hi Leifur, this is Haraldur calling to remind you of your scheduled rehab check-in tomorrow morning at nine or there about - it's OK if you are a little late. You have been very open and candid about your affairs. But I wonder why people generally shy away from talking about this disease, this sickness. I don't like answering that for others than myself, but I'm going to be rude and try: I think it's out of fear. Fear of? So much. Fear of losing, fear of going down in the public eye. It's much better to wrestle with these things in private, in silence. I understand. But you're very bold in discussing your future, aren't you afraid of a relapse... Eva dearest, in my mind it's so clear: The future is a hot tub just around the corner - and I'm cold. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Life takes place in a dirty fish tank. The mud lies at the bottom. You don't hit it when you stop sinking. It's not a concrete basement. You don't wake up when you reach it. On the contrary. Your descent continues through the surface. You vanish into the mud. Into the slimy warmth, convinced that life is finally managable. Soon to be perfect. Just like before birth. Before consciousness.
