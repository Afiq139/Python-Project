CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Hello, friends. [eerie music] On behalf of the Foundation I'd like to thank you all for coming. You are about to enter a safe space. A world free of judgment. Free of shame. In our house no fantasy is too obscene. S##t. ROMAN: All right, Miss Stella Marie, we're almost there. All right, perfect. Thanks again for driving me, hon. ROMAN: Mm-hm. Wouldn't be caught dead around here in the bug. ROMAN: I'm still not sure I want to just leave you here. You sure this gig is legit? It's a lot more legit than some of the s##t I have already done. All right, this is it. This is some weird s##t. [chuckling] Love you. ROMAN: Hey, Stella Marie. Keep your eyes open. [doorbell ringing] WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Greetings. Password, please. STELLA: Pendragon. WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Wonderful. [door creaking] DOOR GUARD: Welcome, madam. May I? STELLA: Oh. [clears throat] Turn, please. Excellent. I think we might have to adjust your hair. STELLA: Really? I thought that this was the right thing? At the door you will be assisted by another member of the Red Guard. They will instruct you as to the correct hairstyle. Throughout the evening should you need anything, anyone wearing a red shirt can assist you. STELLA: Right. Thanks. I'm sorry. Your invitation contains a very specific wardrobe code, and your compliance is mandatory for entry. STELLA: I'll get it right next time. DOOR GUARD: Wonderful. You are now E7. STELLA: E7. DOOR GUARD: Enjoy your evening, E7. [instrumental music] WOMAN: Welcome, madam. Turn, please. May I take your bag? STELLA: Oh, sure. The guy outside said I have to fix my hair. There you go. Have a wonderful evening. WOMAN: (SINGING) All by myself in the morning. All by myself in the night. I sit without you. Table and a chair. I wish you were there as I play Solitaire. [chattering] All by myself I recline. Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry. Watching the clock, without you. I can play the part that won't heal up my broken heart. You left me cold and I'm all by myself. [chattering] [unsettling music] Hey, you made it. STELLA: Jesus Christ. And I see you found your seat. STELLA: Oh, yeah. Yes. Under the romantic glow of the moonlight reflecting off the effervescent porcelain c###s. I'm very happy you came. I was worried I might have scared you off. STELLA: I don't scare easy. Well, that's good. [chuckles] [chuckles] You having fun? STELLA: Well, I actually just got here. This really is out in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. We find the cliff side setting to be a lot more relaxing. It's better to see the moonlight reflecting off the effervescent porcelain c###s. [chuckles] I'll introduce you to some of the regulars, OK? STELLA: Oh, I don't know. I don't want to come off as the bright eyed newbie. Let me prove myself first. Nonsense, Ste-- forgive me, E7. We're all equals here. There's no judgment. Come. Make friends. [instrumental music] These are the golden children. Playing games as usual. D8, Prince of the Forest. We've missed you. DANNY: Well, I'm very happy to see all of you. I'd like to introduce you to one of my friends. This is the charming E7. B1: Pleased to meet you. I'm B1. STELLA: Pleasure. I'm B3. That is a lovely top. So vibrant. STELLA: Thanks. B3: These rude w####s are B5 and B4. STELLA: So you're all Bs. You must be the Foundation's most frequent customers. Um-- What? E7 didn't get the usual tutorial. B1: That's odd. See, I thought it was mandatory for entry. You see, dear, the number system is based off of order of arrival. It's different every time. STELLA: Oh, so first come, first serve? DANNY: Yes. So, E7, what do you do? Or is that topic still on the black list? DANNY: Come, now. You know how Christian is. Christian just wants to be sure that everything is secure so that everybody here can have a better time. B1: Oh, yes. I know how Christian is. B5: Oh, come on. Where is our Royal Highness, King E8? Christian will be fashionably late, as usual. STELLA: But I'm E7. B3: No, no, sweetie. Christian is always E8. E8 is the king after all. STELLA: Where are we allowed to smoke? Um-- talk to that person right over there wearing red. They will point you in the right direction. STELLA: Great. I'll be right here, OK? You know, I'd recognize that voice anywhere. What are you playing at, Prince? D8: I'm not playing. STELLA: Excuse me, do you know where I-- uh-- MAN: Is everything all right? STELLA: Where are we allowed to smoke? MAN: On the patio. I can take you there. What is your name madam? STELLA: Stella Marie. I mean, I'm-- um-- uh-- um-- E-- E7. E7. MAN: Follow me, E7. STELLA: Oh, come on. I know I f###ed up. I won't do it again. I'm sorry. MAN: Please, just follow me. STELLA: I swear to God I won't do it again. MAN: That is true. STELLA: Where are we going? MAN: This way, please. [suspenseful music] Sire, I'm sorry to disturb you, but there may have been a breach in security. Would you mind inspecting her? Lance, my love, you are too free with your pronouns. We don't know how our friend here identifies. STELLA: I'm a girl. Good. [chuckles] What's your name, girl? STELLA: E7. Cool. May I? She looks good to me. Lance, I know we're being stricter than usual with security, but-- LANCE: As requested from the top, sire. But we don't have to be Nazis. Mistakes happen. People need to feel free to enjoy the balls. E7 here looked near tears when you brought her to me. STELLA: No, it's my fault. I went and said my stupid real name. Lance, thank you for everything that you do. LANCE: Your Highness. What is your real name? If you're comfortable. STELLA: Maria. Can I get you a drink, Maria? STELLA: Yeah, sure. [instrumental music] So what would you like to drink? STELLA: I'll drink anything. You must have more preferences than that. STELLA: Mm. What do you like to drink? Wilde Oscars usually. STELLA: [chuckles] I don't know what that is. Well, then you have to have one. DONNA: Coming right up, Your Highness. Oh, you're the best, Donna. I know. So-- Where did we meet? STELLA: In a store. Franklin's? STELLA: Yeah, that's the one. You had lighter hair then, yes? And you were buying six dozen yellow roses for a fundraiser. STELLA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, uh-- I tried this blonde thing that didn't work. [chuckles] No, I thought it was lovely. I remember it. I remember recruiting every single person in here. STELLA: Must be nice. I have a terrible memory. Can I tell you a secret? Come here. Little closer. I lied. I actually can't remember everyone. I don't know who the f##k-- I can't remember. I don't know who let them in, what the f##k? [laughs] No, I have-- I have-- I have a terrible memory also. I do. I just-- DONNA: Two Wilde Oscars. Thank you, my love. Well, then, Maria. Here's to terrible memories. Though, hopefully, not quite so terrible tonight. [bell tolling] [clears throat] It's closing time. STELLA: Already? It's midnight, Cinderella. Drink up. Let's go. LANCE: Attention. A word from her Royal Highness, King E8, or as you may know her, X. [chattering] Well, hello everyone. This is a good turnout tonight. I'm so pleased to see all of you here. You know, sometimes I worry no one will... come. [chuckling] As you all know it is now closing time. For those of you who hope to leave the premises before 3:00 AM you have the next 15 minutes to exit the house. In the meantime, those of you who plan to stay for the After Hours events of the evening please note that the entrance to the house will be sealed. So no ins or outs, except in quick succession. The Red Guard will now come and collect your cell phones. Any of these devices found on your person will be confiscated, and you will only be able to leave at the end of the night after you have deleted any photos or videos that you have recorded. But other than that, tonight, anything goes. We expect-- nay, we demand that you have a pleasant time as long as you respect the privacy and boundaries of all other guests. Except for this b###h right here. [chuckles] The bar will be open for the next 20 minutes. After that, it will be closed for the rest of the evening. Any equipment that you may desire can be provided by the Red Guard. Please, do not hesitate to ask them for anything you may need before you engage. Safety first, everyone. Now, if you have a glass raise it. You're too kind. [chuckles] Now, please, give a warm welcome to the light of my life, our Queen. And you know I hate the nickname, but you insist on saying it anyway. GROUP: Prince of the Forest! CHRISTIAN: Yeah, yeah. Mr. D8 himself, here to announce the top bidder and winner of tonight's special prize. All right, baby. OK. I'm going to go get a head start on last call. I think I'm going to need it tonight. Well, first of all, I'd like to thank each and every you for your very generous contributions tonight. See anything suspicious tonight, watch dog? I don't think so. Not tonight. No one giving you trouble, right? No. But ask me again in 20 minutes. It's closing time. They better not. You tell me if they do, OK? Sure thing, boss. [MUSIC - THE MAJOR ARCANA, "KNAVE"] Dear, you're showing a lot of skin. MAN: (SINGING) Look, you see! Mm. [chuckles] I know. I should've picked something different. Nuh-uh. Not at all. I adore it. I haven't seen you around much tonight. Oh, I know I'm very late. I told the Queen that I wouldn't be here until after dinner and he said it would be all right. Dreadful. You missed a wonderful meal. No matter. The next one will be better. Now, you mustn't tell anyone-- I'm about to be very bad, but remind me where we met? I have had too much to drink tonight and my mind is foggy. The flower shop. I was picking out roses and you helped me settle on the color yellow. Yellow is so in season. MAN: (SINGING) He's got a girlfriend. Remind me what your number is. Oh, I didn't get a number. No? No. Um-- the Queen escorted me in. They said I could be H6, but they ran out of stamps. And that they must have miscounted or-- I understand. Uh-- H6, would you excuse me for a moment? I was supposed to say hello to someone a while ago and it slipped my mind until this very moment. Of course, gorgeous. See you later. Yeah. How you doing, E7? STELLA: Well, I'm going out on the floor soon, but I just had to pee for the last 45 minutes. I kind of have a tiny bladder. That's good to know. [chuckles] STELLA: Is this the only bathroom? Safety protocol. If it's the only bathroom then people notice if a guest is gone for far too long, or comes out sniffing. STELLA: Oh, smart. So when are you going out on the floor? You know, I-- I don't play very often. I like to be a cheerleader and watch. STELLA: Oh, you perv. Uh-- indeed. You know, E7-- [chuckles] I think I was a bit lax with my inspection of you earlier. Would you mind if I did another that was a bit more thorough? STELLA: Oh. [chuckles] More thorough? Just an innocent little thing. Could you take your mask off for me? I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Please? MAN: (SINGING) I feel it in my heart. It's true. STELLA: G##damn it. STELLA: Fine. Whatever you wish, sire. [tense dramatic music] Mm. Lance, at ease for a moment, but stay close. LANCE: Of course, sire. Stella Marie, how on Earth did you get in here? We met at the rose please, remember? Mm. You are not Anna Maria. What gave it away? Anna Maria. S##t. [chuckles] I-- I don't understand how you got the password. I was invited. But I invite everyone. Well, I don't know how this thing works. Are you going to kick me out? Not if you tell me who told you. I told you. I was invited. Look, I really, really, need to pee. I've had to pee for like an hour. You think I want all my friends to know I'm here? A lot of them don't even know what I am. I'm not gonna talk to anyone about your awful parties. Balls. Fine. I'm not going to talk to anyone about your awful balls. LANCE: Sorry, Your Highness. I spoke to the door guards. They've been extremely tight on security. [sighs] LANCE: No one seems to know what happened. It's all right. I know what happened. LANCE: Should I escort her out when she's done, sire? No, but, uh-- keep extra close tabs on her. I don't want to be worried about this for the rest of the night. I'm going to go sit in my chair for a moment and relax. LANCE: Very good, Your Highness. [quiet chattering] WOMAN: [inaudible] WOMAN: [moaning] Baby. [moaning] [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "DANCE OF THE CYGNETS"] [toilet flushes] It's OK. You just have to talk to her. OK, people, it is massively too quiet in here. Let's get back to slurping, moaning, slapping, slamming. There's no need to stare. We've all had those little nip slips of the face. Am I right? Come on, baby. Talk with me over here. This way. This room right here. [sighs] It's OK. It really is. Listen, I've seen most of those people's faces many times. Trust me. It's very hard to toss someone's salad with a mask on. This is different and you know it. [sighs] So now they all know your secret. I'm telling you though, if you go back in there, you're going to learn all of theirs in about two minutes. It's fine. I don't know if this is my scene. I might just sit it out. I feel awful. I should have let Christian know. I should've known that she was going to be like this. To be honest she's gotten a lot better. Well, that's a scary thought. You know, Stella, everyone out there is just like you. No. Writers, graphic designers, business people. Who all know who you are. Which means they've all been getting off to you for quite a while. So I say you get back in there and you blow their minds. I have an idea. Stand up. Up, up, up. Face the wall gorgeous. All right, reciprocate. Take off your clothes for me. Go on. And-- [mimicking dramatic music] Look at the t##s on me now. [chuckles] Are you sure? DANNY: Positively. Now just lean on me, OK? And pretend like you've just had your brains f###ed out. [chuckles] WOMAN: [laughs] DANNY: Mm. Mm, mm, mm. I'll be right there. Wait for me. [rooster crows] Come on, let's pick up the pace. I want to get out of here before Seven wakes up. I'm coming. Why are you talking so loud and yelling and s##t? You think Four over did it a little? Nah, she's fine. Remember her during Christmas? B4: [groans] B4, if you puke in here you're going to be paying. This is premium package, b###h. All right? B4: F##k you. B5: Always talking s##t. [groans] Oh god, my back is killing me. I'm going to go to the chiropractor. B1: All right, who did the damage? It's hard to say. I think it was that girl who came late. Maria? The cam girl? That's right. The cam girl. Yes. Yes, yes. Mm. Yes, yes. B###h is cray, OK? They let her in without a tutorial or anything. Also considering her lifestyle-- I wouldn't let her see my face is all I'm saying. Girl, please. It's her word against ours. Who's she gonna tell? B1: Did you happen to see who she went off with? Well, I was tied to the bedpost most of the night, so. OK, so she wasn't the King's choice. [chuckles] Oh come, on one. Let it go. B5: Mm. Now, King Christian-- That girl is truly kinky. I mean she just comes down. She sits in her chair and she just watches. [dramatic music] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Most people don't understand this, but sometimes a good p##s is better than a good f##k. You tell someone that and they say, yeah, I guess. I see what you mean. No. No, you don't. You don't know what I mean. You don't know me. If you knew me you'd know I live in shame. Glorious. All consuming. Gut wrenching shame. [MUSIC - BEETHOVEN, "SYMPHONY NO. 9"] What would they say if they knew? The girls who come in to mop up the male fluids. The guy j###ing o##. The girl who pees to avoid the oncoming UTI. [groans] The bores who just f##k. Nothing dries me up more. Nothing intimate about it. Slamming body parts together. Sticky and red. God knows why they do it in the bathroom when they have the whole house. [groans] These people-- they'd call me every dirty degrading word they know. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Pervert. MAN (VOICEOVER): Slut. D##e. MAN (VOICEOVER): Disgusting. Pig. MAN (VOICEOVER): W###e. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Hmm. I can't say that they're wrong. Watching people f##k can be just fine, but it's a sport. It's gymnastics or a horse race. It's not intimate though. You can f##k someone silly and never really know them. I know them the way no one does. You're only who you really are when you think no one is watching. I know them better than their mothers, their husbands, their best friends. Knowing that-- [moans] Turns me on. [moans] It makes me crazy. [moans] See? That's better than any video Maria has ever posted. [moans] [knocks on door] ALICE: Christian? Oh, I'm sorry. It's quite all right, Alice. Nothing you haven't seen before. ALICE: [chuckles] Maybe when we first got you when you were about 11. Well-- ALICE: You didn't have those knockers then. Well, they've only improved with age. [chuckles] What can I do for you? Oh, Ray called. He said Lynda won't get in the car. She claims she doesn't remember him. Great. Thank you, Alice. I'll whip you up something real quick so you can eat on the go. [moans] [instrumental music] LYNDA: Be careful now. You almost took my leg off. No, I did not. Yes, I think you did. Oh. OK, Ray. We're good to go. Mm-hm. And just like that she remembers my name. Well, the memory is a fickle thing, isn't it? Unbelievable. What? If you wanted to see me you could have just knocked on my door when you got home. I don't want to do that. I don't want to know the kind of things you kids are getting into nowadays. Oh my god. Let's go now. All right. What? You know what? Alice told me that you kept Ray here half the morning. Well, he doesn't mind, do you? That is what I pay him for. So, uh-- oh, you want me to call St. Catherine's again and tell them that you're sick dear? Hm? You could, but they'd be awfully confused, as I haven't been there in eight years. That-- that's a really long time. Can we just-- Oh, sweetie, you know, uh-- LYNDA: All right, sweetheart. I can take it from here. CHRISTIAN: [sighs] OK. Just remember to tell Alice to text me if you need anything else, OK? You know, sometimes you treat me like I am positively-- Dumb? Senile. I do know how to text, young lady. Of course you do. I'm sorry. Oh. Did you remember to deposit the check-- CHRISTIAN: I did. This week? And you're keeping up with the papers? Well, that's more Danny than me, but you don't need to worry about it. We've got it all under control. I-- no-- sometimes-- I know I give you a lot of flack, but I am very proud of you and your little friend. You're becoming quite the entrepreneurs. [chuckles] We're trying. I still don't know how you kids manage to make all that money. It's the internet. You can do just about anything nowadays with the right marketing. Oh. Well, the Foundation and I thank you. Take the day off. Yeah. Go do something fun. Go, um-- ride a bike. Yeah. No. Christian? Can you do me a favor and deposit the check again-- CHRISTIAN: Of course. This week. BOTH: Just one more time. DANNY: How's she doing? This morning she claimed not to know who Ray was so that I'd have to come and get her. DANNY: [chuckles] The woman is positively diabolical. DANNY: Yeah. Well, I know where you got it from. How did we do last night? A little worse than last month. And that's what you said last month. Hey, we are still far above budget, nervous Ned. Nothing to worry about. I think we need more guards the next time to avoid further security breaches. Listen, Christian. There's really nothing to worry about, OK? Everyone's really just used to the way that things are going now. And last night's breach was a tiny outlier in an otherwise very smoothly operating system. I know. I'm the one who created it, but we can't afford any more breaches. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Light of my life, Queen of my court, and as those imbeciles call him, Prince of the Forest. The only person with the wherewithal to orchestrate the balls right alongside me. The only person who I trust somewhat further than I could throw him. And the only subject who is, shall we say, off limits. Only uses the royal bathroom. What would I do without him? I know he lies to me now, but why? Under the pretense of making me happy? He thinks he knows what's best for me, but I won't be babied. Not even by him. You know, Christian. She's just a girl. Stella just so happens to be a girl who likes to-- CHRISTIAN: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were on a first name basis. You don't call her by her cam name Maria? Don't be s####y. You want to get shut down over a porn star? OK, first of all, technically, she's not a porn star. All right? Secondly-- [sighs] Everything we're doing is perfectly legal. We're on private property and everybody loves us. OK? I mean they all love you. I hear what they whisper to each other every night. Oh my god. I think I'm finally going to get selected tonight. Did you see her? She looked right at me. She's so hot. CHRISTIAN: I'm saying this for the privacy and safety of our guests. Stella Marie might not be a threat right now, but we don't know everything about her. And the next breach could very well be someone with an ulterior motive. It's just facts, Danny. You're the most paranoid person I've ever met. We don't know much about half of these people. Not true. All of these people have had to pass the Christian test before they walk through the door. The Christian test. I forgot about the Christian test. The one you got a $5 million government grant for and spent 10 years of research developing that oh-so fail proof test. So sorry, my love. I know not what I do. Blow me. Not until you learn to chill out. She doesn't even have much to offer. I mean, I'm sure she makes a decent living doing what she does. But when you have to go out and buy new anal beads every week you-- Listen, Stella has other uses besides money. OK? She's very popular. People like her. She could be a draw to people if we decide to start expanding. Expanding? Are you insane? We can't fit any more people in that house. OK, OK, OK. We don't have to expand quite yet, all right? We could just publicize a little bit more. You mean like posters? No. Are you-- what? No. OK, how about the people who give $100 a month shouldn't be let in every single time? OK? Let's rotate the cheap f###s out every once in a while. CHRISTIAN: And what good would that do? It'll force people to donate more. You know? Or instead of scaring them we put a little positive pressure on them. And that's why you want Stella Marie there? Yes, it is. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): No, no, no. You want her there because you think I'll stare into her big brown eyes and fall madly in love and everything will be dandy. I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. Why don't you give her a call and put her through your little test? That way we don't have to worry about this anymore. [MUSIC - THE MAJOR ARCANA, "KNAVE"] His basket's fat in his tight cats. Jack's ajax. Try to relax. His basket's fat in his tight cats. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): The Christian test. While perhaps not as scientific as I would like to think, is not as random and faulty as Danny would like to think either. It requires the right instinct. Sleepless nights. Research. MAN: (SINGING) Right there HP. I think he looked right at me. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Then you need perfect timing. MAN: (SINGING) Jack's ajax. Try to relax. His basket's fat in his tight cats. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): And then after all that-- excellent acting skills. MAN: (SINGING) He's getting close. Omi, can you tell? He talks so gross, but he looks so good. He feels so well like you know you should. Jack's ajax. Try to relax. His basket's fat in his tight cats. Jack's ajax. Try to relax. You say he doesn't play with spades. He only plays with hearts. But when he ogles me I see his Bijou basket of fruit tarts! He's a Jack of all suits, but only parks. When chips are down. When it gets dark. It's getting dark. Omi will get smart. His brand of naff tastes just like home. Oh, must you waste yourself? Homey polone. Try to behave. LMO-- he's my favorite flavor of fruit tart I savor. It's so cruel. He's just a fool. He's not a knave. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Eventually it all pays off. MAN: (SINGING) In his tight cats. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Though they have turned out to be some of my best customers, I can't say I have much affection for these types. MAN: (SINGING) He'll grab you, spike you, shake you, bite you, pin you to the ground and try to take you, fight you, spin you around. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): They're obsessed with image, yet not committed enough to it to really create convincing characters. They want to be the cool kids, but don't want to be too eager to be cool. They think no one knows, but I do. I know everything. I don't have to catch every person with their pants down to be able to see right through them. [yawns] You know, sometimes I wish After Hours started at 8:30. MAN: (SINGING) His basket's fat in his tight cats. It's all the same. It's just like home. I'll give it some thought. DANNY: You should give her a call. I said I'll give it some thought. Good. Thank you for being open minded. Yeah, yeah. God. [groans] Christian, love, I'm going to be doing some baking this evening. Would you like a batch of scones? Sounds great. Are you doing Foundation work? Yeah. I do a week off and then a week on usually. LYNDA: Mm. You gotta keep your grades up. Right. Mm. The doctor was saying to me today that it's important for me to keep painting and keep baking. And I have to start to view my hobbies as a form of therapy. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE"] CHRISTIAN: Uh-huh. LYNDA: Christian, are you listening to me? Yes, Lynda. Jesus. LYNDA: You're not. I can tell when you're not. I am trying to get work done and listen to you at the same time. It is not my fault I don't have two heads. God! Just-- Damn teenagers. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): I'd say I'd forgotten all about him, but it would be a lie. I could never forget my first. I just pushed him further into the back of my brain. I had to quell the longing somehow. Upon first glance Jackson was a typical meat head jock, but there was something else. [unsettling music] D##e. Hey, come on. Go say you're sorry. KID: I'm sorry, Christian! I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. CHRISTIAN: [moans] [thudding] Oh s##t. Oh god. Oh. Oh. So I am still worried about security, but I think maybe you could be right. DANNY (ON PHONE): [chuckles] She could be good for us, but let's just go slow on the expanding, OK? Take it easy on me. DANNY (ON PHONE): Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Of course. Of course. We don't have to expand beyond Stella at this ball. We can do that, maybe, the next time. Well, I mean, we could do like a tiny, tiny bit this time. Like-- well, what about this? Stella Marie's boyfriend. He-- why don't we invite him? He's dating her so he's probably a freak, and I'm sure he's harmless. DANNY (ON PHONE): Oh, I, uh-- I didn't know she had a boyfriend. Well, you need to really sharpen up your Facebook stalking skills. DANNY (ON PHONE): Why would I do that? I have you, the best Facebook stalker in the world. [mockingly laughs] So kind. DANNY (ON PHONE): What made you turn around? Usually just my bitching doesn't work. Well, you are an amateur bitcher. But I'm trying to give my mind a rest. You know? Trying not to end up like Lynda. [chuckles] Trust me, this is not the end of it. If anything goes wrong you will still be hearing about this when we are both 50 years old sharing a cell in the nuthouse. DANNY (ON PHONE): Great. Yeah. I knew this new Christian was too good to be true. [chuckles] I love you DANNY (ON PHONE): Love you too. OK. Bye. OK. [MUSIC - NANCY TRAN, "LOVE"] Hm. [moans] [bell rings] Dear friend-- [moans] The Foundation kindly welcomes you to a masquerade ball celebrating the spring equinox. NANCY: (SINGING) Love is a state of mind. [moans] The ball will take place at 1221 Sea Castle Way-- [moans] --on Saturday, March 19th, at 7:00 PM. Enclosed you will find specific instructions for the dress code. Upon your arrival a member of the Red Staff will assign you your identification number for the evening. NANCY: (SINGING) I've been living a dream. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): On behalf of the red court I look forward to your attendance. NANCY: (SINGING) You taught me how to cry. Gold teardrops-- CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Best wishes, X. NANCY: (SINGING) And I-- I try to clear my mind. And I am losing-- [moans] NANCY: (SINGING) --track of things. So I try to clean out my life. I'm still lost-- I can do that. What? NANCY: (SINGING) --in a dream. I can do it. Oh, no thanks. It's OK. NANCY: (SINGING) You taught me how to weep. The sun goes down, but I can't sleep. But I-- [moans] NANCY: (SINGING) --try. I'm gonna go home now. OK. NANCY: (SINGING) Oh love always fades-- [moans] NANCY: (SINGING) --with time. And I-- [screams] NANCY: (SINGING) --my dream. [sighs] STELLA (VOICEOVER): Hello, stranger. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "DANCE OF THE CYGNETS"] [phone vibrates] Hey! DANNY (ON PHONE): How is the boy toy? It's very casual. We just started dating. DANNY (ON PHONE): I have a little proposal for you. What do you think about doing one of those dance numbers you were telling me about? At the ball? DANNY (ON PHONE): Yeah. Everyone already knows who you are anyway. You may as well use it to your advantage. Spice things up a little. [chuckles] Are you crazy? DANNY (ON PHONE): Not as crazy as the other guests will go if you do it. Yes. Just get me some fishing line and a little hot wax. And I will go up there and do a little cancan. DANNY (ON PHONE): Well, if anyone could-- [chuckles] No. Are you f###ing nuts? Look, I have to go. I'll think about it. DANNY (ON PHONE): You promise? Yes, I promise. DANNY (ON PHONE): Ta, ta, my love. Oh. You are very early. Well, my dear I came to save you from a gluten overdose. CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] They're for the party. Why? CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Because in 10th grade Jackson gave an about me presentation in Spanish class, and said his favorite flavor was cherry. Because they're delicious. And I think the guests will like them. I guess Lynda gave you her secret recipe. No. No? Let me show you something in the freezer. Is it a dead body? Holy wow. [chuckles] She made every last one for my after school snack. I can not believe it. You enslaved the senile songstress. No. The doctor says cooking is therapy. Yeah? I'm helping. DANNY: You are unbelievable. Oh my god. What is that? This is the prize for tonight. Ooh, what is it? Be very careful. Let me touch it. No. Let me touch it. No. Christian, be very careful. Let me touch it. It's 18th century erotica from Rome. Just be careful. Mm. Lovely. I know. You should put it down somewhere. Well, every surface is an ocean of scones. They might get lost at sea. Well-- oh, I guess that's fine. [chuckles] I got you something. Mm. Is it a golden scone? Please shut the f##k up just this one time. All right. I'm sorry. Mm. Dear god. [clears throat] For my Red Queen. Have you been embezzling? [scoffs] No. How did you manage that then? Every day Lynda gives me $10 for my allowance. Christian. I'm serious. No. This is awful. I can't accept this. OK. You have to tell her. I do. Every single day. She can see my face, Danny. It's not like I'm hoodwinking her. [sighs] I used to try to give it back-- put it in her purse. But she gave me the same bill over and over again every day for about six months. At some point what does it matter? I might as well use it for something important. So-- Yes? --the florist will be here in about 30 minutes. She's early because we're having around three times the normal number of flowers. And the music people aren't coming anymore because I did it all myself, including Stella Marie's request, which I thought was a little unoriginal, but hey it's her dance. Oh, and I got more candles 'cause the other ones are going [goofy vocalizing] Oh, and the ice is going to be here in about an hour, but I'm not sure if I trust those guys those guys 'cause they look like-- How do you breathe talking this fast? You did everything. I have nothing else to do. So what going to do is I'm going to have another one of these scones, and go j##k o## for the next three hours just to kill the time. Why are you being coy when you know I don't want you to be? What ever are you talking about? Did I do good? Babe, you did amazing. I can feel it in my bones. Tonight's going to be the night that we make those numbers bounce back. Fingers crossed. I have no doubt. Just, um-- What? Don't get your hopes up about whatever it is that made you do all this. It's just another night. Of course it is. Come here. Long live the King. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): My darling Queen, I forgive you. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE"] [chattering] Now, don't let me have more than one of these. I want to go easy tonight. [gasps] I'm shocked. Leave her alone. Gosh. You know, I'm not try carry around a## out her. like I did last time. I don't want to get too smashed tonight, at least not until after the show. Yeah, I'm excited. Who knew baby girl could dance too? A woman of many talents. B1: Speaking of which. B5: Holy s##t. DANNY: Damn. Well, well, well. STELLA: Oh, you like? DANNY: I-- yes, I like. You came. I did. And you agreed to Danny's proposal. [chuckles] STELLA: Well, he was pretty adamant. Mm. STELLA: We mustn't disappoint the Queen. Indeed we can't. My lady usually gets what he wants. [chuckles] STELLA: Christian? Yeah? STELLA: What's wrong? Has anyone ever told you you're an excessively forward little bird? STELLA: [chuckles] I'll take that as a compliment. Nothing is wrong. I guess I'm just a little confused. STELLA: By what? I didn't think you were coming alone tonight. STELLA: That? I guess I haven't made things very clear, have I? I'm just a really private person now, if you can believe it? I can. We are only our true selves when we are alone. STELLA: Yes. Exactly. I'm not the same girl from St. Catherine's. Clearly, you aren't either. No. [chuckles] STELLA: I'd like to start fresh with honesty for once. I'd like that. STELLA: To be honest, I don't even remember why we stopped talking in high school. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Liar. I don't either. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): And another lie. STELLA: Terrible memories. Mm. Right. [chuckles] I guess we're more alike than we thought, E7. STELLA: Tonight I'm C1. And in terms of me coming alone-- Jackson and I aren't officially dating. It takes a lot for me to make someone official. Oh. STELLA: But I also won't be alone tonight. He's just coming late. Well, um-- C1, privacy becomes you. And I am so glad for your honesty. STELLA: Yeah? You never know how the night's going to end around here. [chuckles] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): A few more minutes to prepare. Maybe even a whole half hour. Perhaps I'll Donna to make the Bee's Knees double strength. STELLA: The only thing I've learned in life so far is to never think you know the answer. Well said. Uh-- excuse me, C1. I have to go-- I have to go tell Donna something. And get a towel. I'm a mess. Gosh, excuse me. STELLA: See you later. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE THEME"] So what was that all about? STELLA: Nothing. Oh my god. [laughing] [chattering] JACKSON: Sorry I'm late. Hey. They said to give this to you. BOTH: Hi. STELLA: Watch the mask. Oh, come on, on, take it off. Well, you cleaned up well. I love this. [chuckles] I've never seen this before. Oh my god. Can you even see me with this mask on? Oh my god. Chris. Sorry. Wow. Look at you. You look great. How are you? Wow. No one has called me that in a very long time. Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry. Old habits, you know. This is incredible. Who would've thought, right? Quiet, bookish, little Chris. Well, I guess that's what they say, right? You always did work harder than the rest of us. I wasn't blessed with strength or charm so I kind of had to. Oh, nah, nah, kid. You were just a late bloomer is all. [chuckles] And you got my girl to perform. A master of persuasion as well. Well, that was my partner. Oh, your partner. Danny, my business partner. Oh, right. Well, I'm indebted to you both. She told me she'd never perform ever again. STELLA: I never said never. I said teaching takes a lot out of me. Ah. Teach? Well, I'm sure the girls thank you for it every day. STELLA: [chuckles] Uh-- I don't know if I told you this, but I'm a virtual teacher now. I teach English to girls in boarding school in Spain on my webcam. Wow. That's very good of you. Yeah. She spends all night by herself on the computer. My little baby's going to get carpal tunnel. [chuckles] I'm so sorry. Wow. That's dangerous. Yeah. Um-- Can I, um-- Can I get you a drink? My-- Donna-- she has created some specialty cocktails for tonight. That sounds great, Chris. Fantastic. All right, let's just, uh-- go to the bar. [chuckles] DANNY: (SINGING) The best things in life happen when you're dancing. STELLA: Oh, get the lampshade ready. Don't blame me, OK? You blame these drinks. They're the strongest I've ever had. And they go right through you. I mean, I've had to pee like 10 times. I've had three and I'm fine. Oh, well. STELLA: Well I shouldn't have any. I'm going to go get ready. Gotta primp. [chuckles] So you're the boyfriend? Uh-- that's a-- that's a strong word. Oh, is it? Pardon my French. What word do you prefer? Danny. Um-- we're just taking things easy, you know? Yes. No need to rush. I understand. You want to make sure you know everything about each other first, right? Hey, Danny, honey. I think maybe it's time for you to go get the stage set up. Aren't you doing that? No. We agreed it would be you. Oh. Can you just do it this once though? I need to make real good friends at this counter top right here. Regain some stability back in my life. Hm. Yeah. OK. Um-- I'll be right back. Thank you. You're the best King I ever had. AMBER: (SINGING) Lonely. I'll give the world if I could only. Mm. Mm. F###ing delicious. Try this scone. Sure. [chuckles] AMBER: (SINGING) It surely would-- Oh. See? So, man, tell me something. OK. Who are the freakiest chicks in here? CHRISTIAN: This all has to be perfect. Yeah, good. And then clean that all off. Clean all that off. Let's get all of their, um-- garbage from here. In fact, let's just get all the people out. Yeah. Um-- can you go get the blue light for me? To the right. DANNY: Here's one for that one. JACKSON: All right. Let's do it. DANNY: Very good man. Yep. Yeah. [chuckles] DANNY: All right, round two in two minutes. AMBER: (SINGING) I have tried in vain. JACKSON: [chuckles] You pussy. AMBER: (SINGING) To call your name. JACKSON: I might - DANNY: [chuckles] Alright. Go. Fine. JACKSON: I'll see you in a bit. AMBER: (SINGING) That will never make us part. STELLA: [heavy breathing] Christian. STELLA: [heavy breathing] LYNDA: (SINGING) All by myself in the mornin'. What? LYNDA: (SINGING) All by myself in the night. I-- Oh. What? Uh-- Oh, s##t. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. No, no, no. No. No worries, dear. Sorry. I heard music. I thought this was just another part of the-- Oh, you know, Christian never tells me when she's planning to have company. [chuckles] Oh my god. Lynda Rue? Yes. [chuckles] Oh my god. You're-- you're Lynda Rue? LYNDA: Yes. She didn't warn you guys? [chuckles] Yeah, I figured that. Of course she didn't. This is your house? Yes. She won't let me join the PTA. She's worried-- too much attention drawn to her. I don't know. [chuckles] Well, I never knew. Now you know. Silly me. There we go. How do you do? Lynda Rue. Hi. Hi, I'm Stella Marie. Um-- Christian and I-- we were in the same class. You were? Of course you were, love. Oh my goodness. Well, how are you? I mean, is Christian having a few friends over right now? Um-- uh-- yes. LYNDA: Well-- well, good. Yeah. We're just having a little party. No. No worries, you know. All you St. Catherine kids-- you're good kids. I know you're going to clean up after yourselves. [chuckles] You know, I think I'm going to just pop my head in for a moment, huh? What do you think? Let's do that. [hums musically] Something like that. Ooh. [piano music] Could you get me-- [inaudible] [chuckles] Could you hold this for me, dear? I just have to take care of something. No worries. LYNDA: Slide it in. [MUSIC - LYNDA RUE, "ALL BY MYSELF"] So handsome. (SINGING) All by myself in the mornin'. GROUP: [cheering] (SINGING) All by myself in the night. [suspenseful music] WOMAN: Oh my god. That's Lynda Rue! Lynda who? OK? S##t. F##k. S##t. I'm dead. LANCE: Excuse me. Okay, slow move. I didn't or-- [interposing voices] LYNDA: (SINGING) Playing solitaire. I get lonely. Watchin' the clock on the shelf. I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder. I hate to grow older all by myself. All by myself in the mornin'. All by myself in the night. I sit alone with a table and a chair. So unhappy there. Playing solitaire. All by myself. I get lonely watching the clock on the shelf. I'd love to lay my weary head on somebody's shoulder. I hate to grow older all by myself. All by myself. GROUP: [cheering] Thank you. [inaudible] Thank you. GROUP: [cheering] LYNDA: So glad you can all be here. If you don't mind I'm going to retire to my bedroom. Please enjoy the party. Hey. Take me. Take me. [interposing voices] B3: Perfect. It's perfect. Who thought of that? B5: Who came up with this? Prince, come on. Come on. Walk with me now. I'm about to pay you. DANNY: All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're not done yet. To the stage-- Where is my Christian? Oh, my sweet King darling, where are you? It's OK. I'll find her in a bit. I can go it alone. Let's give a nice big, warm, round of applause to a burlesque queen on the rise. Miss Maria. [MUSIC - THE MAJOR ARCANA, "AT THE DEVIL'S BALL"] MAN: (SINGING) I had a dream last night that filled me full of fright. I dreamt that I was with the Devil below in his great big fiery hall. Where the Devil was giving a ball. I checked my coat and hat and started gazing at the merry crowd who came to witness the show. And I must confess to you there were many there I knew at the Devil's ball. In the Devil's hall, I saw the cute Mrs. Devil, so pretty and fat, dressed in a beautiful fireman's hat. Ephraham, the leader man, who led the band last fall. He played the music at the Devil's ball. In the Devil's hall I saw the funniest devil that I ever saw taking the tickets from folks at the door. I caught a glimpse of my mother-in-law dancing with the Devil. Oh, you little devil dancing at the Devil's ball. DANNY: [chuckles] All right. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give one more round of applause to this burlesque queen, Miss Maria. Hey, baby. Hey. Don't touch me. OK. Well, it looks like you're drinking wine. That's Lynda's wine, dear. It's my house. OK, well, why don't you go get a drink from the bar, all right? It's closed, remember? OK. Well, you're drunk enough as it is. Oh. Look who's talking. Come on. This is not my fault, OK? It's you that made the drinks that strong, all right? I saw you over there whispering things to Donna into her ear. You don't think I see these things, but I do. CHRISTIAN: Yeah. I can say whatever the hell I please to Donna without your assumptions. Thank you. Why are you so angry Christian? You know, I have about $12,000 in my suit pocket right now? This is the best ball we've had yet. Yeah. Thanks to burlesque grandma and her sidekick Maria, cum facial princess. Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on, Christian. What the f##k are you even talking about? You weren't there, OK? The crowd was loving it. It was just great. A nice little surprise. Honestly, it really worked in our favor. Right. What the hell is even your issue with Stella Marie? She doesn't do that kind of s##t, OK? That's seriously really judgy of you. CHRISTIAN: Well-- [sighs] My issue is-- Yeah? --that she wasn't even supposed to be here in the first place. I don't trust her. I didn't trust her! And now I'm proven right. Great or not, she went wandering through my house, and that proves it. Proves what? Oh my god. It proves that she's the same as she was in high school. DANNY: OK. That she's always-- always spying on me, and judging me, and digging into my secrets trying to figure out how to destroy me. Shh. She meant no harm, Christian. How could she know that was Lynda's room? Not everything is about you. Of course you vouch for her. You brought her here. You snuck her into the last ball. Come on. Don't deny it. You know, I just thought that-- You just-- you just thought that what? That you knew best? Like always? Always belittling me and making me feel like I'm crazy. You are a little crazy. You are so naive. DANNY: I thought maybe you liked her. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE THEME"] [gasps] What? DANNY: I mean, you're always talking s##t on her. You're always saying mean things. And then I go and meet the girl and I'm thinking to myself, this girl's actually a really, really sweet gal. And I'm wondering-- CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] --why has Christian always said all this mean stuff about her? And then I realized it. You actually like her. CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] It's not that crazy of an idea. I mean, everyone up there really likes her. People hate her. They think she's trash. DANNY: What are you talking about? They've just come here to watch the freak show. DANNY: I get it. You're jealous. You're jealous. [chuckles] People actually like Stella for something that she does. Whereas people like you because you're all mysterious, and weird, and you make people think that you're going to f##k them, but then you don't. You don't think I see you sitting here on your f###ing couch every night? Danny, stop. You're also so f###ing arrogant. You can't even stand a real genuine person who actually has talent and drive. Genuine? Yes. She lied to Jackson. He doesn't even know what she is. Who gives a flying f##k about Jackson? Some meat head jock she nails every now and again. They're not even together. You know that? But why does she get the title genuine, and I get the title jealous and crazy? DANNY: Because, Christian, you have it good. She has to make it on her own in a world that hates people like her. And you have everything you could ever possibly want, but you are still not satisfied because at the end of the day it's Lynda that bought it for you. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And-- and instead of-- instead of being grateful for what you have-- CHRISTIAN: Danny. --you have to twist it into this sick little inadequacy You have to make it how everyone else in the world is out to get you. You can't even take-- DANNY: --a simple f###ing gesture. Danny, could you, please, just-- DANNY: You have to take everything the wrong way. Just-- would you, please-- DANNY: You have to pervert-- --just shut up! [groans] [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE THEME"] [sighs] Danny. Danny. S##t! S##t! S##t! F##k. [sighs] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): I've never watched the live feed before, but I'm not going back up there now. [suspenseful music] What the f##k? What the f##k? As though this night couldn't get any worse. So she remembers. She's the only one who ever a caught me in the act. The only one who could possibly ever suspect a camera. It's not there or there. [scoffs] And Danny thinks I like this girl. Move the towel. Move the towel, Stella. [scoffs] [electronic beeping] [suspenseful music] B1: All right, I'm just going to say it. I think that was the best one yet. Hands down. Even better than the one in October. B5: Mm-hm. B3: Agreed. B4: I think I gave the Prince my entire trust fund. B5: I think one of the Red Guards all of my cocaine. [dramatic music] What the hell is on this memory card that's so important? [phone rings] STELLA (ON VOICEMAIL): Hey, this is Stella. Leave a message. [phone rings] Should've backed it up. [phone rings] [phone rings] STELLA (ON VOICEMAIL): Hey, this is Stella. [phone vibrates] This sort of thing happen often? Ah, she's a little bit volatile, but nothing like that's ever happened. Yeah. She was so mellow when we were kids. Yeah. Well, no offense, but you didn't really know her back then. Fair enough. I don't know what to do, man. Maybe cut it off. Hey, here are your wings. Oh, beautiful. [chuckles] Just in time. I gave you two extra. I can see. You're the best. How are you? Uh-- I've been better. It's OK though. Yeah? Yeah, it's good. How's Christian? She's, um-- she's doing well. Yeah. We're all a little bit hung over so she took the day off. Thank you for everything. Mm-hm. Tell her I say hi. Definitely will. Yeah, thanks a lot. OK, bye. Yeah, uh-- that was a bad night. What are you talking about, man? I thought you had a good time? [coughs] Well-- What? Listen, I gotta tell you something. I, uh-- I think I did something kind of bad. WOMAN: (SINGING) Singing every song. [tense music] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): I can't stop thinking about her. She's the only person who could possibly have known about the camera. The only one who could've taken the memory card. Did she sober up, go back, and find it? [phone rings] Did she take it to f##k me over or to save herself? Use it as evidence to go to the police? STELLA (ON VOICEMAIL): Hey, this is Stella. Leave a message. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Where are you? I have to relax. I-- I can't f###ing think straight. Just for a minute. [unsettling music] God f###ing damn it. I'm f###ing disgusting. F###ing slut, d##e, pervert. Christian? Oh-- What? [chuckles] What? Oh my god. Could you knock? I'm not dressed. I was just-- came to check on you. You've been in here all day. Well, I'm pretty g##damn tired. OK? Why are you so tired? CHRISTIAN: [groans] I've got a lot on my mind. What? Your AP test isn't for two months. Oh my god. Why are you yelling? Don't you know anything? [chuckles] What is this attitude that I'm getting? I swear to god I'm going to kill myself. [sighs] Why are you being so difficult? There is no AP test, Lynda! Why are you so moody? I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm a teenager going through puberty. Oh, no. It's because I'm 26 g## damn years old and living with a person who thinks I'm 12! I do not think that you're 12. [chuckles] Could you leave me alone? Sweetie, Christian-- Please? Fine. All right. Don't have to be such a little b###h about it. I have to find her. Oh my god. [wind rustling] JACKSON: Christian. Hey, Chris. What are you doing down here? Just walking. Oh, right. Where are you headed? Um-- That way? I'll walk with you. I think it's a shortcut anyway. That makes no sense. Sure it does. You know, Chris, I've, uh-- actually been meaning to talk with you. Really? Yeah, um-- I think-- I think you may be in need of some help. With what? I know everything you do. You-- you mean well. You never try to hurt anyone. How do you know that? Well, you have a good heart. I can tell. Look, Chris, I think-- I think you and I both know you made some mistakes at that last party. Did some things you shouldn't have. We all do things we shouldn't, don't we? [chuckles] You know, I always said you were smarter than the rest of us. I am. Look, kiddo, I know-- I know everything. You know what? The fight. Well, the mirror. The camera. Yeah. [sighs] You? Mm-hm. Well, someone has to make it stop. I see. But then who will stop you? Stop me? Well, I saw. Before the card disappeared I watched live. That's not normal. Neither is what I saw. [chuckles] I don't think you know what you're talking about. I think I do. Look, Chris, just take it out of there. Never do it again. Nobody has to know. You'd like that, wouldn't you? I don't know what you're implying, but the camera doesn't have any sound. I don't think you can be sure of anything. I know what I saw. Yeah. Well, you're never going to see it again. Why don't you go home, princess? [chuckles] [dramatic music] [phone rings] DANNY (ON VOICEMAIL): Hi, there. This is Danny Peterson. I am not at my phone right now. Uh-- leave a message. Hi. It's me. I-- I don't know what to do. I just really need you to answer me. [groans] Things are bad. Things are awful, [chuckles] I f###ed up with you and me, and-- with some other stuff too. I don't-- I don't know where else to turn. I know I don't deserve it, but, please, if you still care about me at all just call me back. I miss you. I made some awful mistakes and I didn't trust you. I didn't trust you because I'm a liar. I f###ed up, I felt bad, and I put it all on you. I don't expect you to forgive me. But, please, don't leave me. Text me or call-- Your recording has reached maximum length. [shouts] STELLA: Christian? Hi. What are you doing here? Just-- I was just looking for you. Did you come to tell me about that thing with Jackson? Yes. STELLA: Well, you don't have to. I don't? I broke up with him last night. He, um-- he found out about my secret. And it was just-- it was just all bad. Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Are you? Yeah. I'm-- I'm fine. Do you want to come inside? I don't know. I have some good news. What? So-- the day after the last ball. I randomly get a call from a theater downtown. And they do vaudeville revival shows. And they hired me to dance burlesque for them. Wow. That's great. You have talent. Thanks for coming to see me. It really means a lot to me that you care. Of course I do. What are you going to do about Jackson though? Mm. Let's not-- let's not talk about that. But I'm OK. Should I do anything? Do you need any help? I'm a big girl. I'll figure it out when I have some time. Thank you for everything. I'll text you. [tense music] CHRISTIAN (ON VOICEMAIL): Don't leave me. RECORDING (ON VOICEMAIL): To delete this message press-- I'm sorry, bro. I know this is like the worst thing that could've happened to you. Yeah. I don't know if you'd be interested, but we, um-- we're looking for someone in the marketing team in my office. Maybe you should leave the Foundation for a while. [sighs] I mean just-- just give it some time, and then you can rethink your relationship with her. Yeah, maybe. She needs a lot of help, Danny. When I saw her today she was just positively manic. She was just walking up and down the streets aimlessly. Well, she needs to go to rehab, or she needs therapy, or something. I don't know. Well, maybe being away from her best friend for a bit will help her see that. Maybe you're right. What did you do with the card? JACKSON: The card? DANNY: The memory card. I deleted it. Threw it away. [phone rings] [phone vibrates] [unsettling music] DANNY (ON VOICEMAIL): Hi there. This is Danny Peterson. I am not at my phone right now. Uh-- leave a message. B3: What the f##k? B5: What is this? B3: How long has this been going on for? B4: How much more footage is there? B5: I know this is bad. B3: Who knows where this is going to end up. B5: Maybe no one will see it. B4: Like, she-- she won't f##k me, but she wants to see my t##s? This b###h-- I gave her so much of my money. Christian. There's something you need to see. B5: I trusted-- B4: God, I would've f###ed her if she asked. B5: And now-- B4: And it's on the internet. My parents are going to see it. B5: The damage is done. CHRISTIAN: Danny. DANNY (ON PHONE): Hey, Christian. CHRISTIAN: Danny. Thank you for calling, I really-- DANNY (ON PHONE): I wouldn't just not call. I just needed to think first. CHRISTIAN: I don't know what to say. DANNY (ON PHONE): [sighs] I don't really either. I'm so sorry. I know that's not enough. I know nothing will be enough, but-- DANNY (ON PHONE): I'm sorry too. I'm sorry for what you're going through, even if-- It's all my own fault. [chuckles] DANNY (ON PHONE): I have to leave, honey. OK. DANNY (ON PHONE): There's no other way this just-- isn't right for me anymore. Yeah. I understand that. But just could-- can we talk in person? I have some things I want to tell you. I'm not going to ask you to stay. I just-- I want you to know something. DANNY (ON PHONE): I can't do that. Why? DANNY (ON PHONE): I can't face you right now. Just for 10 minutes? I-- I promise I won't ask you to stay. DANNY (ON PHONE): I can't. Why? DANNY (ON PHONE): Because you'll make me change my mind, and I can't afford to do that with you, Christian. Everything is f###ed. My life is f###ed. I'm really g##damn lucky Jackson was able to get me another job. Danny, please, can we just talk? And don't take that job with Jackson. Don't do anything with Jackson. I'll try-- I'll do something to make it clear to people that you weren't any part of-- DANNY (ON PHONE): Christian, stop. I'm not coming back. I can't. It's too much at once. But I need to talk. DANNY (ON PHONE): Look, I will tell everyone I meet, from here until the day I die, that you're a good person. And you don't deserve this s##t no matter what you did. That you're worth a hundred of these people, but I can't stay with you anymore. I can't. I'm sorry. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE THEME"] CHRISTIAN: Danny, are you there? Danny? [groans] [screams] WOMAN: Pervert. MAN: D##e. MAN: Disgusting. [groans] S##t. [yells] Oh, s##t. F##k. [chuckles] [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE THEME"] [chuckles] [cries] DANNY (IN MEMORY): You have to take everything the wrong way. CHRISTIAN (IN MEMORY): Would you, please-- DANNY (IN MEMORY): You have to-- DANNY (IN MEMORY): --pervert everything. CHRISTIAN (IN MEMORY): --shut up! [cries] [audience applauding] JACKSON: It's OK. It's OK. You did the right thing. It's over now. I swear to you on my grandmother's grave I have no idea how that footage got out. I mean, maybe she did it to herself. You know, maybe she felt like she-- she needed to confess. And this was the way she had to do it. Why don't I go out? Hm? Why don't I get us a nice bottle of wine. We've both had long days. We need to relax. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. OK. [unsettling music] I hope it's all right. I decided to get beer instead. Danny? Danny? STELLA: Oh my god. Jesus Christ. I realized I never returned your keys. Well, you could have returned them without giving me a heart attack. Sorry. I, uh-- I also wanted to see how you were doing. I promise I'm fine. I don't care about that stupid video. People have seen way worse than that. Yeah, I meant with, uh-- you know? Yeah. I want you two to be happy. Yeah. About that. I also wanted to talk to you about that. Um-- what happened at the party-- I'm not going to deny that I participated. It's just-- I was extremely drunk and what happened after I-- Let's just say I was never fully consenting. And I got myself in a bad spot where I didn't want to hurt someone's feelings. We're not together. I'm not that way. I just-- I made a mistake out of curiosity. And then I got cornered by this person who was very, very, drunk, and then had no self-control. What are you saying? [sighs] Nothing. Nothing. I just-- I just want you to understand that-- that I didn't not fight the breakup because-- because I'm gay or something. I did-- I did it because I think you deserve someone who wouldn't embarrass you the way that I did. I-- I wanted better for you. Well, thanks for that. You're a good person, Stella. I think you deserve a good guy. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, "SWAN LAKE THEME"] [knocks on door] Hello. Hi. Hi, I'm Christian's friend. Mm-hm. Um-- can I come in? Um-- all right. STELLA: What are these? Oh, they're for the Foundation. I can take them to her. Where is she? Oh, she's in a room. She's been sleeping quite a bit lately. [clears throat] [coughs] CHRISTIAN: [groans] No. No. [sighs] How do you keep getting in here? You look like you're dying. I'm fine. I am free. Finally free of people and their stupid opinions. That's just swell, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't, you know, get dressed at some point -- [groans] STELLA: --in the day. I'm sorry. Does this bother you? [goofy vocalizing] [chuckles] Why are you here? Bringing you these. Ooh. STELLA: What are all these anyway? Ah. RSVPs. STELLA: Those idiots still want to come back? Probably just to tar and feather me. Well, this is a g##damn mess. What do you care? Isn't this what you wanted, Miss Nosey? The emperor caught without his clothes. Wait. What do you mean what I wanted? Why the f##k would I want any of this? CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] Please, don't play all innocent with me now. You used to follow me around in high school trying to figure out who my parents were. OK, I was 16. Caught me coming out of the men's bathroom, and called me names. What? CHRISTIAN: [sighs] You know what I'm talking about. [unsettling music] Oh my god. You're a total pervert, aren't you? Oh my god. [chuckles] You think this is funny? STELLA: No. No. No, not really. CHRISTIAN: You really didn't remember at all? STELLA: Well, not that part. CHRISTIAN: How did you get into the first ball? STELLA: Danny. CHRISTIAN: Why did he want you here? To try and set us up. Uh-huh. And why did you search every drawer in the guest bathroom last weekend after your performance? What were you looking for? You're a f###ing psycho. You're a parody of yourself, you know that? I was on the rag. I was bleeding through my g-string. I was looking for a tampon. You have 10 different types of condoms in there. CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] Every lotion known to man, but no f###ing tampons. What kind of woman are you anyway? I'm not a woman. I'm a pervert. A dog. A pig. [oinks] You're a loon. That's what you are. CHRISTIAN: Mm. And what about Lynda? What about her? CHRISTIAN: Why did you go to her room? It's not even in the main house. I was looking for you. How'd you hurt your arm? Well, I got upset. There was more to that footage. Things that got cut out. That night I was watching all of you live and I saw something. Something really, really, bad. Happen to someone who I thought was you. STELLA: Because he had my mask. What happened to him? Jackson happened to him. JACKSON: I was extremely drunk and let's just say I was never fully consenting. Oh my god. We have to tell him. He has blocked my number. Let's go over there and tell him right now. We can't. Why not? We have no evidence. The footage is gone. Deleted. Dying in a trash file on a computer in a public library no doubt. So what? Let's go over there and tell him anyway. CHRISTIAN: You don't understand. If I tell him I will look like an absolute monster. Making up atrocities just to get him to talk to me again. I can allow him to believe that I'm a pervert, a psycho, a b###h, but not that I would concoct a rape just because I am sad. The day that you came to see me. You thought it was me? And you didn't have any evidence of what happened then. CHRISTIAN: Well, the world didn't know I was a pervert then. Also I hadn't punched you in the face two days earlier. Well, what if we could convince the world that you weren't a pervert? [chuckles] How would we do that? Lynda. What? STELLA: We say that Lynda was paranoid. And that she was old and scared. And that there were cameras all over every inch of the house because she was terrified of the paparazzi pestering her. And that she wanted to be left alone because she was sick. I'm not going to do that to her. She has a perfect, unblemished, reputation as a saint. It won't ruin her reputation. No one's going to blame a little old lady for being paranoid of the paparazzi spying on her. We say that someone, somehow, found the camera in the bathroom. They stole the memory card. That we have no idea who it is. No one's to blame. And Lynda won't even remember the brief news blip. If she even sees it. It's not right. It's also not right not telling Danny. You can shut the f##k up. You think you know everything? You tell him. Go put the cherry on the top of his already fan-f###ing-tastic sundae. That's what I thought. And you know I'm right. You know I'm right about Lynda. You know the whole reason why Lynda put the Foundation in my hands. The whole reason why she isn't in the public eye is because she wanted to be remembered as Lynda Rue, the singer. She didn't want everyone thinking of her as, oh that beautiful singer who is now old and fragile. That woman who used to be talented, but has now lost her mind. I won't let the last thing about her in the world's collective consciousness be that she was a paranoid freak who kept cameras in her bathrooms. That would be the ultimate betrayal to her. Also I should probably stop lying. STELLA: You're going to stop lying? Yes. STELLA: You're going to tell the truth about everything? Yes. STELLA: Do you like me? CHRISTIAN: What? Did I stutter? You're ser-- you're seriously going to ask me that right now? You're deflecting. [chuckles] OK, I think it is seriously f###ed up that you're laughing right now. STELLA: And why is that? Because my life is in ruins. This whole thing is funny because none of this would have happened if you weren't so afraid to answer my first question. I don't know what you're talking about. You are a scared, scared, little child under all that pervy exterior. OK. You can shut up now, really. Now you're just being a b###h. [unsettling music] [gasps] [moans] Mm. Nuh-uh. No don't. Christian-- No don't touch me. STELLA: You're a little damaged aren't you? I think I preferred it when you called me a pervert. STELLA: All right, then. You're on your own. It's your cross to bear. First off, I'd like to thank you all for coming. Five years ago Lynda Rue entrusted me with her foundation. I have broken that trust. Everything you have heard, speculated, feared-- it's all true. I am a creep. I am a deviant. A voyeur. A pervert. I will no longer be a liar. In the guest bathroom I kept a hidden camera. I am sure many of you wonder why I didn't just lie. I could easily have chalked it up to a little obsession with security. I could even have blamed one of you. It would have been easy. Multiple people have told me that, but-- but I won't. I won't do that to any of you. You came here with purer intentions than I. And though the world may judge you for those intentions. I-- I want all of you to know that I have also been caught with my pants down. [chuckles] I wish I could have kept your secrets and my own safe, but I failed. Though I have made the decision to be honest I must admit that not much else has changed. I will continue despite everything to hold events for the Foundation every month. What? And at each of these events After Hours will continue as it has for your pleasure. And in the guest bathroom there will be a camera. Though now the guests will be checked and the camera will be inspected to ensure it still has its card. Your secrets will remain within these walls, but I will still be watching. As I always have been since the very first event here almost five years ago now. If this does not suit you I will not judge any of you for leaving. While I have watched over each and every one of you, though in ways to which you did not consent, please know that no matter what act, environment, or object you used to find your ecstasy I looked on you with the eyes of an admirer. Not the eyes of a judge. I hope you can forgive me. [chuckles] And extend this poor pervert the same freedom from judgment even though I do not deserve it. Thank you. [sighs] LANCE: OK, that's it you're out. Get-- hey. [thumping] [groans] B1: Hey, hey, come on. LANCE: Hey, hey. B1: Let her go. LANCE: OK, that's it. Get out. You're out of here. OK. LANCE: Get out of here right now. ANNA MARIA: Are you OK? Are you OK? LANCE: All right. LANCE: She did not ask for that. MAN: Hey, hey, relax, my friend. [interposing voices] AMBER: (SINGS) All by myself in the morning. WOMAN: Pervert! [glass shatters] LANCE: Whoa. Whoa. Who did that? Who did that? [yells] OK. LANCE: Hey, hey, hey. Get out of my way you stupid bastard. LANCE: Put your clothes on. That is-- [inaudible]. B5: Let me go! MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody needs to calm down right-- AMBER: (SINGING) As I play Solitaire. All by myself I recline. Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry. Watching the clock without you. [chuckles] Let's go. LANCE: Oh, wow. Oh, no. Not the table. OK. OK. All right. OK. All right. OK. I see-- AMBER: (SINGING) And I'm all by myself. Hey, Christian. I just wanted to say I'm sorry I wasn't able to make it tonight. I guess I like sneaking in better than being invited. Maybe now that we're both out of the shadows we can both find a way to be happy. Anyway, you know where to find me. Looks like your party got a little out of hand, kiddo. Yeah. I guess I don't really know what I'm doing. It's all right. Lance is on it. He'll kick 'em out. You need a blanket. Leave the scones. Thank you. WOMAN: [yells] I didn't think you'd come. DANNY: Liar. You didn't have to, you know? I know. AMBER: (SINGING) All by myself in the night. They're going to tear the house down. Yeah. But still this is the best turnout we've had so far. [chuckles] [chuckles] Besides, everybody loves a good pervert. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): It was just the kind of thing Danny would say, but as it turns out some fantasies are too obscene. AMBER: (SINGING) Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry. Watching the clock, without you. I can play the part, that won't heal up my broken heart. You left me cold and I'm all by myself. [MUSIC - THE MAJOR ARCANA, "KING"] SCOTT: (SINGING) Feel that chill. She's coming. She'll chew you up with salt and glass. She's coming. Wings on air. She's coming. Look in the glass. She's there. Now gone. All hail the King. All hail the King. Long live the King. AMBER: (SINGING) Crown made of string. They said my mouth was bloody. Tied to the stakes, flames in my eyes. Long live the King. Long live the King.
